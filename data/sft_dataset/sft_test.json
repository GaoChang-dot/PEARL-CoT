I can totally understand why you're stressing over that!

How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?\nseeker:Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions.\nsupporter:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way.

I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be\nsupporter:OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!\nseeker:Yeahhh\nseeker:Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice\nseeker:made me feel ebtter\nsupporter:If I were you I would not wait!

Am good just concerned about my son.\nsupporter:Oh I see.  What's happening with your son?\nseeker:I suspect my son is in bad company. His most recent behaviour is so different from what I am used to\nsupporter:Oh that's hard to deal with.   My daughter ran with a bad crowd for a while and I remember the deep worry.\nsupporter:What sort of behaviour are you noticing?  How old is he?\nseeker:My son is 15. Recently he's keeping to himself and mostly stays locked in his room. He barely allows anyone in.\nsupporter:And when you try and talk to him about it what does he say?\nseeker:He says he's studying online. But I suspect he's doing other stuff online apart from study\nsupporter:Oh I see.  Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school?  Is he still seeing his friends at all?\nsupporter:It can be scary not knowing what our kids are up to online.\nseeker:Not really. He just has this one particular friend who comes over sometimes and they lock themselves in the room.\nsupporter:Hmm.  So a lot of mystery.   I can understand you being worried.   Is he your only child?\nseeker:I am so scared I don't want to confront him I have always tried to show him how much I trust him as away to make him feel responsible enough\nseeker:Yes. He is my only child and I am single parent\nsupporter:Thats good parenting!   Perhaps if you frame it as being about you, e.g. \"I am getting really worried, can you please explain....it's affecting me (affecting my sleep/work/whatever\" .... maybe it will inspire him to be more forthcoming\nsupporter:Any signs of depression?   I have been depresed before, and self-isolating can be a symptom, I've been there...\nseeker:Never thought of it that way. That could be a possibility. But he always seems happy and we chat a lot onlythat he his behind closed doors in his room for a long time everyday.\nseeker:Am also concerned about the friend who comes over. I don't really know his family or home just that he's from the neighborhood and they go to the same school.\nsupporter:Hmm.  My other thought is tell him what you just told me, that you have been trying to show him that you trust him....but be honest and tell him you are afraid.   Hopefully, he won't want you feeling that way, and will open up a bit.\nsupporter:Yes I can see that being concerning when you know nothing about the friend.   Yet you walk a fine line because he needs the freedom and autonomy to choose his friends without explanation required...it's such a balancing act.   I can tell you that I have raised a daughter, and that teen years were tougher than toddlerhood.   Lots of worry, but she came through it and is fine now.\nsupporter:I wonder if there is a teacher he is close to that you could bring your concerns to, perhaps the teacher may have some insight about yoru son to offer?\nseeker:I find reassurance from your words. Its been tough for me this far we have come with my son and I want us to be close even as he growing up to become a young man. I have a good relationship with their teacher and will definitely give her a friendly call to know more from her.\nsupporter:Oh good.   And it may be just a normal part of his development.

At the start it was fun and we got along great. I think we have little in common these days and I don't feel the same way I used to. I don;t want to hurt her feelings but I'm thinking about ending the relationship.\nsupporter:Have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?\nseeker:I have felt like this for a while now but I'm thinking about if more nowadays. It doesn't feel right and I don't know who to handle it.\nsupporter:So you have felt for a while that things aren't right in your relationship and you don't know how to end the relationship without hurting your girlfriend's feelings?\nseeker:That's correct yes. I worry that she will be very upset and the thought of her in distress does concern me. It might be easier to stay together but I don't think that's the right thing to do.\nsupporter:I can tell that you are a nice person that cares for your girlfriend and you want the best for her. I think you want to be honest with her which is a good sign of maturity and integrity.\nseeker:Thanks for that. I do care for her which is why I don't want to upset her.\nsupporter:Unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. I had a friend who had a similar issue. He wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.\nseeker:It is good that it is possible to do this and still become friends afterwards. I do worry about how this would go and am fearful that she will react badly.

Oh, and by the way, things are running WORSE than they were before, but it's being blamed on COVID\nseeker:Problem with the \"retirement strategy\" is that it means going out on a limb with no job with the holidays coming up, and with COVID with no end in sight.

We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.\nsupporter:I wish for your fast recovery.

There should be some permanent solution for it.\nseeker:I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.\nsupporter:We can still hope for the best right now.

Everything is usually good except for my one coworker who tries to boss me around. She is very unhelpful and hypocritical\nseeker:You cannot even talk to her without her interrupting or being rude. I am trying to find a better way to deal with the situation\nsupporter:I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?\nseeker:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens\nseeker:I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult\nsupporter:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down.

Talking to HR should help.\nsupporter:What do you think?\nseeker:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally\nseeker:Our office is small so it would likely just be my boss who I have mentioned it to before. I think of it as she may not be working here that much longer\nseeker:and is only part time now\nsupporter:Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home.

What have you done to face it in the past that works for you?\nseeker:I have tried going to support groups and therapy. I also take medications. Despite this I still feel overwhelmed.\nsupporter:It sounds like you have tried a lot of different methods, so good for you for taking care of yourself. What is overwhelming you?\nseeker:The situation with COVID is scary. I just found out someone I care about may have the virus. I am a worrier anyways so it is hard not to feel butterflies in my stomach about the issue.\nsupporter:It is a very scary time we are all living through, so it's very easy to understand your higher anxiety with someone you care about maybe facing it. What can you do to feel better?\nseeker:I can try to keep myself busy and practice self care. It is hard though because I still worry. Sometimes I feel too worried to do the things necessary to stop it all spiraling\nsupporter:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the \"pause\" of the pandemic.\nsupporter:Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?\nseeker:I have practiced breathing techniques and meditation before and think that is a great suggestion. At the moment I think the only thing that would ultimately really make me feel better is knowing my friend is okay. He already has health issues so it is a worry.\nsupporter:Absolutely, and it's completely understandable, but it's very hard to wait. I hope that you are able to practice some of the techniques we talked about, and seeking help by talking about it is part of self-care, too.

My levels of stress and concern have been higher since the pandemic began.\nsupporter:Sorry you have been feeling down. What are some strategies you have tried to help you cope?\nseeker:Well, I have tried to get my mind off of it by activities at home. Spending time with my family.\nsupporter:Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.\nseeker:Yes, but I still seem to struggle with feeling a bit more down than I'd like. Not sure what to do.\nsupporter:Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.\nseeker:I have tried meditation before, but quite a bit back. Do you have any activities you could recommend, without risking my health? Maybe in my own home, so that I can social distance.\nsupporter:One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.\nseeker:Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out.\nsupporter:Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same. It is harder nowadays with covid but there are many online groups. You could even start your own group!\nseeker:Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too. Maybe I should block the ones that have mostly negative posts?\nsupporter:I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control\nseeker:I wished I had some more ideas on some fun, interesting or things to fill my time at home. I often feel I get in a bit of a rut with the same thing. Since we are home more now.\nsupporter:Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?\nseeker:Well, I used to read quite a bit more, but I have slowed down on it. Maybe I should go and grab a few books.

So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.\nseeker:That is great advice.

Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common.\nsupporter:Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work.\nseeker:She had heart  surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category.  I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.\nsupporter:I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).\nseeker:What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet.\nseeker:You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.\nsupporter:Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help and that's a big deal! A good next step might be letting the people around you know that you need some support at this time.

Hope you are doing great\nsupporter:I am well. What's going on?\nseeker:yes, have a friend who I'm very close to , but have noticed she doesn't tell me the truth this days. And not only that she has been distancing as in not calling , always waiting for me to call. I call her about a week ago, but wasn't happy how she dismissed my call within seconds telling me she will call me back only for her not to call till to day. I don 't feel like calling her again.\nsupporter:So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are. It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right?\nseeker:You are absolutely correct and this is someone I care so much about\nsupporter:This must be very hard on you.\nsupporter:How does this make you feel?\nseeker:Oh it is very depressing, have known her for a very long time about 16years now\nsupporter:Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger\nseeker:That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.\nsupporter:I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.\nsupporter:I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!\nseeker:I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

If I don't get at least a B I'm not going to pass this class.\nsupporter:I can definitely understand why that would be stressful. Do you have anyone to help you study?\nseeker:I do. There is a study group of people in my class. I am preparing really well but I've struggled with this class so much that I still get really worried.\nsupporter:It sounds like you are preparing well but are still worried that it won't be enough. Does that sound right?\nseeker:Yes, that's right. I feel like I could literally study 24 hours a day and it won't be enough. It's hard to know if the information is really getting into my head, and if I'm actually understanding it all.\nsupporter:Sometimes taking a break and clearing your mind, taking a few deep breaths, can help people calm down. Is that something you can do?\nseeker:I have tried that. And it does kind of help in the moment. It's when I get back to studying that all of the anxiety sets in. And it gets worse as it gets closer to the test. If I'm not studying, I feel guilty that I'm taking a break.\nsupporter:I understand that. I have felt the same way before. But I realized I don't have to feel guilty for taking a break. It's important for my mental health.\nseeker:And I try to remember that, too. And I know that's right. But in the moment I feel guilty, so it's so hard for me to relax taking a break.\nsupporter:Just in the conversation I can see how stressed out you are and struggling with how to handle that.\nseeker:Yes. Once my head is in this stressful mode, it's hard to break free.\nsupporter:Sometimes talking with a close friend can help. Have you tried that?\nseeker:I have. And that does help in the moment. It's always when I get back into the actual studying that it's a problem. I think getting the test over with is the only thing that will help.\nsupporter:It sounds like the actual studying is what is causing you to be stressed.

I'm really lonely and kind of sad.\nsupporter:I'm so sorry to hear that.\nsupporter:Do you mind me asking what is going on that is making you feel this way?\nseeker:Thank you. I broke up with my girlfriend. It was the right thing to do, but now I'm really lonely and sad.\nsupporter:I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds to me like you're having a hard time dealing with the emotions that you're dealing with after having broken up with your girlfriend. Does this sound right?\nseeker:Yes, that's right. It's been really hard.\nsupporter:I can tell that you're really struggling.\nseeker:Thank you. I was with her for about a year. It was good at first, of course.\nsupporter:I've dealt with these emotions myself. I recently broke up with my now ex-boyfriend. I have been feeling these same emotions.\nseeker:I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? The loneliness gets so hard, especially when you just want to tell something to someone.\nsupporter:I know it feels terrible, but I think that you reaching out for support is a great first step! I'm really proud of you! You will get through this!\nseeker:Thank you. Honestly, I'm glad you're there to reach out to.\nsupporter:We were together for about 5 years. Yes, the loneliness does get very hard.\nsupporter:I'm happy that I can be here to help you and so that you have someone to talk to! I promise to do my best!\nseeker:Oh wow, that's a long time. And thanks. I appreciate your optimism! I am usually very upbeat and optimistic myself.\nseeker:Thank you. I really appreciate it. Hopefully I can help you somehow too.\nsupporter:After my breakup, I found that the best thing to do was to involve myself in other activities that I enjoyed in order to take my mind off of the negative feelings that I was dealing with.\nseeker:The shiba inu in my profile circle is making me smile. I used to have a shiba inu. :)\nsupporter:You seem very kind! I appreciate your willingness to be here for and to listen to me as well!\nsupporter:Aww! That makes me happy to hear that seeing my profile picture is making you smile!\nseeker:That sounds really smart. I've been trying to do that. Of course with a pandemic going on it's more difficult.\nsupporter:Have you considered getting into any hobbies to take your mind off of what's going on?\nseeker:No no... my profile picture. Yours shows up as a squirrel. lol\nseeker:I usually hike a lot, but my hiking groups aren't going out right now.\nsupporter:Oh! I'm so sorry! Haha!\nsupporter:Have you considered things like journaling, reading, or arts and crafts?\nseeker:Maybe I should get a pet squirrel?\nseeker:Yes, I actually read and write quite a bit. Especially for work. That's not overly therapeutic, but it helps nonetheless.\nsupporter:That may not be a bad idea! If you really like them and are able to properly care for it, animals can be very therapeutic!\nseeker:I have one dog who isn't much bigger than a squirrel. She has been an invaluable companion.\nsupporter:Writing and reading have been proven to be extremely therapeutic. I used to write down my feelings on a piece of paper and then destroy it (throw it away) once I was done. There's something about it that really seems to help.\nsupporter:Aww! That sounds like an adorable dog! What breed of dog is she? I have two cats myself. They make me feel better on a daily basis!\nseeker:I've tried to keep a journal but I never stick to it. I find that writing letters to friends serves me the same purpose, and it helps me to stay connected, too. Plus, people love getting real, hand-written mail.\nseeker:She is a miniature dachshund. Today she went to the bank with me, and all of the tellers came to the window to look into the car at her. lol  I like cats too. Animals are so healing.\nsupporter:That sounds like a great idea! I love the fact that it helps you to stay connected, especially considering (as you already mentioned) that it's difficult to connect right now since we're dealing with COVID-19.\nsupporter:I love that you're telling me about your dog and how all of the people at the bank wanted to see her! I bet that made you feel much better.\nseeker:Yeah, and you're right. There's something therapeutic and cathartic about hand writing that typing does not replicate.\nseeker:Yes, it made me happy to see them fawning over her. And it made her happy because they gave her treats.\nseeker:Dealing with issues during Covid is so rough.\nsupporter:I couldn't agree more. Dealing with COVID on top of everything else has been extremely difficult for me. Honestly, I think it is part of what caused a lot of the issues that I'm currently dealing with.\nseeker:I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes.\nsupporter:It makes me happy to hear that you know that you're better off. I know it's sad, but accepting that a relationship wasn't meant to be is, in my opinion, the first step to truly getting over someone. A year is a long time to spend with one person.\nseeker:I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders.\nseeker:So is five years! I hope everything works out for the best for you, too.\nsupporter:I completely agree! Where would you go if you were able to right now?\nseeker:If there was no virus... maybe Scotland or Las Vegas to see some shows. Or up into Canada. (I'm in Pennsylvania.)\nsupporter:Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.\nsupporter:OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol\nsupporter:Is this your first holiday alone?\nseeker:Yes, exactly!  And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash.  A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary!

Everything feels like hard work.\nsupporter:To be honest, I feel the same way sometimes, too.  It is nice to have someone to talk to about this.

Do you have any advice on what makes you feel better?\nsupporter:Yes.  I agree.  For me personally, I noticed if I think back of a time before I lost my motivation, sometimes it helps me to reenergize a bit.\nsupporter:What have motivated you in the past?\nseeker:Hmm, I'm finding it hard to remember a time I didn't feel like this! I feel like this has been going on forever! I used to enjoy walking, and generally getting things done around the house. I am also self employed and loved putting time into my business but I've been finding that hard recently.\nseeker:I've been watching a lot of Netflix and youtube and not doing much else.\nsupporter:I have been spending a lot of time home by myself as well.\nseeker:How do you cope with it?

My days tend to go better.\nseeker:I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.\nseeker:That's a good idea, I could try that.

I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.\nsupporter:Have you tried reading?  I find reading motivates me sometimes, too.

There are a lot of interesting channels that talks about science, technology, personal health, ... etc.  That can be beneficial to you and worthwhile.\nseeker:I do watch a lot of youtube, but it's mainly true crime I am into. I always forget there is other content on there other than what is in my subscription box.\nsupporter:Certainly.  I have a pullup bar and some weights at home.  Even without those, sometimes I just do some bodyweight exercises, such as pushups, squats, ... etc.\nseeker:Home workouts would be good. Do you use an app, or just make up the moves yourself?\nsupporter:Yes, the YouTube algorithm is not always the most helpful sometimes.  You can try logging out to see if you see some other recommendations.\nseeker:I will do that after this chat, and see if I can find any home workout videos on there.\nsupporter:I used to be in the military, so I have a rough idea of what exercises I can perform and how much of it I can do each time.

Participating in social events geared toward your interest might be able to connect you to people with similar feelings!\nseeker:I think so too. I never thought of it like that.\nsupporter:I'm sure that you are trying your best to be both a good student and a great parent. It is understandable that you may not have considered those options.\nseeker:Yes I constantly think of my son and family, and I didn't think involving myself in sociable activities\n would be beneficial.\nseeker:I figured I really needed some alone time. I didn't realize I could be experiencing loneliness.\nsupporter:It is so admirable that you are acting so selfless.\nsupporter:Are you aware of any activities that you can participate in that can include your family? It could be the best of both worlds.\nseeker:Yes, we like to go swimming at the YMCA together.\nsupporter:That is great! Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress levels.\nsupporter:My sister-in-law really benefits from having her sons in sports. She is able to connect with the other team moms and considers them some of her best friends. Depending on your YMCA your son may be able to participate in some of their programs?\nseeker:Yes, and swimming is great exercise.\nseeker:And if we do that more we can spend more time together.\nseeker:I have been looking into putting him in soccer.\nseeker:He can start at 3 years old.\nsupporter:Soccer would be a perfect way for both you and your son to interact with other people of similar interests.\nseeker:I think so too. You gave me a lot to think about today that I didn't consider before.\nsupporter:I am glad to help, Hopefully, considering these options will not only reduce your stress from being busy with being a parent and with school, but it will also bring you closer to your child.\nseeker:Yes, and both of those are major goals of mine. But the stress sometimes feels inevitable.\nsupporter:Sometimes stress is inevitable. You just have to know how to channel it. Some use physical activity, others use journaling. These seem to be outlets you can consider?\nseeker:The physical activity for sure.\nseeker:I do so much writing with my Master's program. Sometimes I feel like my hand will fall off.\nsupporter:Physical activity seems to be the option you are most interested in.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

He hasn't been in contact with me as much since I left for school.  I just expected more.\nsupporter:Well,  it sounds like you're both in kind of a transitional period in life.

As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too.

How can I help you\nseeker:I'm having a problem with one of my friends.\nsupporter:So you are having issues with your friend? That is upsetting . What is the issue?\nseeker:She has been having a problem with a different friend for years. I have been listening to these problems for all of that time. And even though it's so frustrating, because it's the same problem over and over again, I keep listening because she's my friend. But lately I have been going through a lot, and I haven't had as much time to sit and listen to these same problems, and she gets so angry telling me I don't care about her. The problems I've been going through are very serious, and I just don't have time to sit on the phone listening to the same stuff I've been dealing with for years.\nsupporter:I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling.  I would feel that way too\nseeker:It's been really rough. I've tried so hard to be there for her, and I feel like she just doesn't even appreciate it.\nsupporter:I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate?\nseeker:Yes, that's exactly accurate. And she is 50 years old, and the issues have all been high school type problems that I've been listening to. Stuff about how she didn't post on social media about her birthday, and little petty things like that. Not something an adult should be concerned with. And I still sat and listened to her all that time.\nsupporter:I completely understand how unappreciated and stressed this would make you or any person. Especially when our plate is full and its the same old same old and nothing is changing. Its like thinking doing same thing over and over you will get a different result when 2+2 equals 4\nseeker:Yes, exactly.\nsupporter:You are an extremely good and loyal friend and I am so proud of you. Most people would have left her.\nseeker:Thank you. That's really important to me. She was starting to convince me that I wasn't a good friend because I wasn't there for her right now when I had problems of my own. Real problems - like my daughter's engagement breaking up.\nsupporter:However, it is time to take the hard road. YOu are going to have to say with LOVE because its not always what you say but how you say it.  Give me a minute to please type it\nseeker:Okay, thank you.\nsupporter:You are going to have to sit her down and say  I need to be honest with you.  I have always been there for you but you are not willing to take my advice or others advice and quite frankly I just can't do it anymore. IF you want to remain friends I need you to grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you or even me.  Right now I could really use a good friend. I am going thru A LOT OF Sh** and I don't need this in my life. So\nseeker:I think that's a good idea. I'll try that.\nsupporter:if you aren't able to do that than I am afraid until you can be a true friend and not just a user than I need to end this friendship . I don't want to but I need to for my mental health and for myself and even for you.  I say this because I love you and I do care but this has become toxic\nseeker:Yeah, I like that. I think it's a good idea to say those things to her.\nsupporter:she really needs to hear it and it sounds toxic to me . I know I wouldn't want a friend to accuse me of not being there and from the chat look like its all about her and she s acting like a spoiled brat\nseeker:I agree. She can't see past her own issues to see the whole situation.\nsupporter:If you think its a more serious problem maybe ask her to seek professional help.\nseeker:I might try that if this doesn't work.
