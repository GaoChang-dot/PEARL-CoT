Talk to your doctor?\nseeker:Yes, she suggested so. But I am not convinced.\nseeker:I see many friends getting relying on the medication even after they feel OK.\nsupporter:What about counselling .. would you consider that? There is some very good therapy available\nseeker:I haven't thought about it...maybe not familiar with the circumstance.\nseeker:Maybe different culture that I have grown?\nseeker:I also have many friends who were not satisfied with counseling.\nsupporter:True - I know different cultures do take different approaches to things and in some places talking about mental health is taboo\nseeker:I have no idea what to do.\nseeker:that's why I look for another support.\nsupporter:I would recommend giving counselling a go, even though you're not totally sure about it\nseeker:what if it doesn't work and cost a lot?\nsupporter:Is it not possible to get it free? It is provided free in my country\nseeker:very costy here in the US\nsupporter:Ah, you need to move here to the UK ;)\nseeker:also varying by the healthcare providers.\nseeker:I didn't know that the UK has such a good coverage.\nsupporter:We don't have to worry about the cost of medication or counselling as we have socialised medicine\nseeker:can you please explain further about socialized medicine?\nsupporter:Sure. Everyone pays a small percentage of their income - depending on how much they earn - and it goes to fund the NHS. Everyone is therefore eligible for free hospital treatment etc and we pay a standard amount (about ten pounds ie fourteen dollars) for a prescription, no matter which drugs we are gettign\nsupporter:If I needed a heart transplant tomorrow it would be free :D\nseeker:I see.

I moved out of our place and all, but we continued to see each other at least 3X per week. And we both said we're not 100% sure that we're ok with us being done for good. - We promised to tell each other if we start dating anyone. He said he wasn't interested in dating.

It is true that he didn't keep his promise, and that's his fault.\nseeker:That's true. He didn't invite me over. I expected him to be at work that night. I was coming over to see our cats, which still all lived with him. I still had a key and it didn't occur to me that I could invade his privacy since I had been spending 3X a week with him, and he was fine with me using the key. The whole thing was a shock.

Maybe they could help me.\nsupporter:True, many people do not understand depression. I actually have found it easier to find a person who DOES understand and not talk to those who don't.

Don't wear the mask if you can help it. Seeing smiles helps.\nseeker:I haven't been exercising nearly as much since March. Maybe I need to start walking again.\nsupporter:I personally don't know anyone who has died and my nurse friends say it is no worse than the flu. So I try not to worry. What I think about is so critical. I try to pray about what I can't handle, then move on, change my thoughts.\nsupporter:Walking is GREAT!

They just had flu-like symptoms, but he was in the hospital for 9 days.\nseeker:That was almost 3 months ago and he is still feeling the effects of it.\nsupporter:So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you.  And of course, pray.  The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and I still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so I try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.\nseeker:I like your idea of changing thoughts. That would help keep me from \"going down the rabbit hole!\"\nseeker:I had a bad cough and got tested several weeks ago just in case. But I didn't have it.\nsupporter:Here is a good saying -- if you want to change your feelings, change your thinking.  Feelings are like the tail on the dog, they follow thoughts. So keep your thoughts positive, cultivate an attitude of gratitude, even write a list of of things you are thankful for.\nseeker:LOL! That's great!  I'll have to remember that \"feelings are like the tail of the dog\"!  That's a cheerful way of thinking about it!\nsupporter:I'm almost 60 and my husband is 66. We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but I believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around!\nsupporter:Well, I hope I have encouraged you.\nseeker:Yes, I think walking, changing my thoughts, praying, and taking care of myself will really help. Yes! You've really helped me out.\nseeker:I just turned 64 and my husband is 69. He is really, really healthy because he takes care of himself so well.\nseeker:He has a handicapped younger sister and he always wanted to be around to take care of her. So he has always taken care of himself!\nseeker:Thanks so much!\nsupporter:So we are about the same age then!

I lose my temper constantly and say very racist things.\nseeker:I need help with my anger. I am upset that the Presidential election is being stolen from President Trump. I say racist things about it, and punch myself in the head or bang my head into the wall when people disagree with me.\nsupporter:Where does your anger stem from ?\nseeker:I think it is because people disagree with my politics.\nseeker:I am sick of being discriminated against because of my skin color.\nsupporter:Its ok to disagree with people about topics but you need to figure out why it triggers so much anger which turns to hate\nseeker:Half my family is Puerto Rican, I am White. All the Puerto Rican family members consider themselves to be allies of the blacks, I do not. I have been repeatedly victimized by black people,\nsupporter:How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel\nseeker:I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too.\nseeker:Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife.\nseeker:I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors.\nseeker:Are you going to help me?\nsupporter:I see I too have had my issues with other races. A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do\n you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.\nseeker:I walk home because my job is only a mile away. I live in a predominantly black area. The police have taken reports, but candidly admitted to me that nothing would happen as far as arrests because of the current \"woke\" climate.\nsupporter:I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists\nseeker:It upsets me, the way I feel. I do have 2 or 3 black neighbors who are decent people, but thats it. I am the only White person on my street. I am constantly taunted by the blacks in my area.\nseeker:No black woman has been raped by a white man in recent history, even DOJ crime statistics back me up on this one. When is the last time anyone remembers a pack of white men raping a black lady?\nseeker:I just want to not be scared around here anymore. I am sick of being victimized.

Almost had a good day and then got treated bad in the end so I don't know why I try.\nsupporter:I understand how you feel. It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct?\nseeker:That is correct.\nsupporter:Who is treating you badly? Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?\nseeker:My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess.\nsupporter:That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.\nseeker:Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better.\nsupporter:Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?\nseeker:I have tried many times. It always ends up my fault in the end so I don't bother anymore and just take it.\nsupporter:It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.\nseeker:Thank you. It gets trying at times. Tonight, I just sit in the dark alone because it isn't worth the hassle.\nsupporter:I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.\nseeker:That is for sure. Most of the time it is just the way life is but there are days I get fed up and it irritates me. It has been this way for a while.\nsupporter:From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.\nseeker:I won't divorce...even if I am miserable, that isn't an option.\nsupporter:I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.\nseeker:I have gotten used to it. It is the way I am supposed to live my life I guess.\nsupporter:Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.\nseeker:He knows I am miserable. He knows I am upset. He is the living room watching tv and I am in the bedroom. It doesn't bother him that I am upset. It is getting late where I am and I should probably go to bed soon.\nsupporter:Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it. Take a few calming deep breaths and engage in self-care, you deserve it.\nseeker:Thank you, good night.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

That's going as well as you would think it is.\nsupporter:I know separation isn't easy, especially with children involved. How are you coping with this transition?\nseeker:I guess im okay, a little shaky and still find myself in tears from time to time. Honestly it is nothing new for me. I've suffered from depressions since i was a young teen\nsupporter:Well breakup is not easy so what you're feeling is normal. Have you ever sought out professional help for depression?\nseeker:Yes I go to the local mental health. I'm actually bipolar 1 which kinda makes my depression a little worse. I see a counselor twice a month. I still however have some trouble in between visits. I just can not afford to be seen more often.\nsupporter:Are there hobbies or activities that you do that help you cope with issues such as jogging, reading, etc.?\nseeker:I read a lot and play rpg games to distract myself. My kids are a big help too.\nseeker:ill admit there are some days despite trying to distract myself i stuggle.\nsupporter:Its good to see that you have activities you participate in that helps you cope. I also play video games to just get away mentally too. But yes, even hobbies are not the cure for issue but rather helps with the symptoms.\nseeker:Oh really what kinda video games to you escape into? I like RPG, romance, adventure, and simulation\nsupporter:I love to play shooters and sports lol. I will be getting into the VR world very soon.\nseeker:Oh i love some shooters. But VR scares me honestly. I heard it can cause seizures\nsupporter:I'm scared as well as it may feel too realistic for me.\nseeker:Yea god forbid playing a shooter in VR O.o\nsupporter:hahaha...Have you tslked to family and friends about the situation? How did they respond and what suggestions did they offer?\nseeker:Well my mama suggested i just forget my ex and not be depressed. My grandpa suggested once i get divorced i should just move on. My brother asked if i wanted him to beat his ass XD lol So not much help honestly\nsupporter:Do you want the relationship to be over or you are truly done and want to move on?\nseeker:I realize i am glad its over. I realize i did not love him like i thought i did. I'm sad that my babies had to suffer for me to realize this.\nsupporter:Although it's tough for the children, it's positive to hear that maybe it was for the best. The family seemed to echo your same feelings so it could be for the best.\nseeker:I certainly hope so. I wonder sometimes. I hope i haven't ruined my kids lives by leaving their father.\nsupporter:Some children may act out if they have trouble expressing how they feel. I would suggest having regular talks with them and being transparent.\nseeker:Yes we had a little trouble with my 8 year old. He thought i and his grandma chased his daddy away.

I also have been having a hard time in quarantine.\nseeker:Plus my work hours have been cut\nsupporter:Do you have people you can talk to digitally? Friends, family?\nseeker:I have family but they live on the west coast im on the eastcoast\nsupporter:I get that. It can be really frustrating when you feel alone and like you've got no one to talk to. Especially when 2020 seems to be dumping things on you.\nsupporter:What have you been doing to pass the time? Is there anything that you've found that makes you feel better?\nseeker:So my money is now running low and rent is coming due\nseeker:I like to read\nsupporter:That can be handy!\nseeker:I like to walk on the beach\nsupporter:Is that something you can do with regularity? Getting out and walking?\nsupporter:I know that I've had good luck battling my depression by just finding ways to not be at home. Hiking, going for walks, going for drives...\nseeker:Yes I live on the beach but its so cold right now I cant even do that. I feal so isolated\nseeker:Im going to do that tomorrow\nsupporter:Good! It's hard to start, but it's a good way to start. How far do you plan on going?\nseeker:Im going to bundle up and go to the beach. Probably walk down to the pier 1 mile\nsupporter:That will be good. Make sure you can take some time and really appreciate not being in the house.\nsupporter:Is there any music or podcats you can listen to while out?\nseeker:Thats good advice, Im feeling a little better\nseeker:I can take my iphone for music\nsupporter:I am glad. Practicing mindfulness can really help, and help put things in perspective. Often times we build things up to be even worse than they already are. Being able to be grateful for what's around can help, without diminishing the issues that you are facing.\nseeker:Thats good advice, thanks I think you helped me\nsupporter:Remembering that it's okay to be sad and depressed, as much as it sucks, can be helpful in reframing. It's a rough time for everyone and you definitely are not alone.\nseeker:Thats true, it just seems like I am alone cause well I am lol\nsupporter:I absolutely get it. I work from home right now so it's just me all day. Sometimes, I literally only talk to my cats. I am a crazy cat lady.\nseeker:Cats are cool\nsupporter:I had a whole cry and freak out moment when part 2 of quarantine hit recently. I wholeheartedly understand.\nsupporter:Do you have any pets?\nseeker:I have a Russian Blue cat ssmart very smart cat\nsupporter:Smart cats are the best. They know when you need cuddles, which it sounds like you do! Also means you aren't alone. ;) Cat needs ya! As much as they don't want to admit it.\nseeker:He's my buddy for sure.  Makes me happy to think of him\nsupporter:If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!\nseeker:Thats a good idea I'll look into it.  Well we better wrap this hit up?\nsupporter:I believe it needs to be a minimum of 20 minutes and we are at 17 right now.\nsupporter:For the max that is, lol.\nseeker:Oh sorry thought it was 15 minutes. So where are you at?\nsupporter:West Coast of all things! WA st, so lots of hiking for me. It's been helping so much.\nseeker:I moved from Renton to here in Myrtle Beach SC\nsupporter:Oh hey! So all of your family is here then. What prompted the move?\nseeker:Got real tired of the weather and people there\nseeker:Everyone friendly here and actually talk to one another\nsupporter:Ha. I believe that. I was born and raised in Puyallup, so it's all I know. i couldn't ever think of leaving.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD.\nseeker:I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD\nsupporter:Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.\nseeker:I have a traumatic brain injury that creates a lot of overstimulation in my life. I used to be social and now I can't be in a social setting for too long without feeling exhausted\nsupporter:Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?\nseeker:Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week\nsupporter:That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic.\nsupporter:Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?\nseeker:I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family\nseeker:I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said \"are you not better yet?\" and another said \"can't you just walk it off?\"\nseeker:When I got into my second car accident, people said \"again? are you drunk?\"\nseeker:Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were\nsupporter:I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.\nseeker:After my first car accident, the tow truck guy was towing my car to my aunt's garage to hold for auto insurance appraisal. He said to my aunt \"sorry for your loss\" My aunt said \"oh, she's right over there and alive\"\nseeker:the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died\nseeker:but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off\nsupporter:Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.\nseeker:Thanks.\nsupporter:A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.\nseeker:What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem?\nseeker:That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate.\nsupporter:I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.\nseeker:Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on. The whole saying of \"they don't deserve you at your best when they weren't there when you were at your worst\"\nsupporter:You are 100% correct. Have you looked into any support groups at all or tried to connect with anyone with similar experiences through social media?\nseeker:I don't use social media\nseeker:I quit in 2016, which is also when I started realizing how vain people are\nseeker:Some of those same friends and family didn't bother to text me even though they had my number\nseeker:I did find a local group that did social stuff together but they were all really old like 50 years plus\nseeker:I'm in my 20s so it was hard to relate\nsupporter:Gotcha! Well I'm glad I was able to connect with you this evening because sometimes it helps just to chat and have someone listen :-)\nseeker:Thanks! I appreciate it.

They help a lot.\nseeker:It isn't, but I guess it's because they don't really know what *depression* feels like.\nseeker:Really? What do you do? Maybe they could help me.\nsupporter:True, many people do not understand depression. I actually have found it easier to find a person who DOES understand and not talk to those who don't. When I talk to those who don't, it brings me down, so I find a good friend I can confide in.\nsupporter:I can understand being discouraged to and not knowing who will understand you.\nseeker:Yes!! Talking to someone who doesn't know what it feels like REALLY makes me depressed!\nseeker:I'm wondering if it is the pandemic that is making me feel worse?\nsupporter:I find it important to take care of my physical being first: eat well, drink water, exercise, get fresh air. Don't wear the mask if you can help it. Seeing smiles helps.\nseeker:I haven't been exercising nearly as much since March. Maybe I need to start walking again.\nsupporter:I personally don't know anyone who has died and my nurse friends say it is no worse than the flu. So I try not to worry.

Sometimes you have to take a leap, even though you are not sure what might happen. So far everything has worked out fine for me.\nseeker:That's true.

It is nice to be your own boss and choose your own hours.\nseeker:I currently do day trading on the side and make great money at it but want something stable to challenge me\nsupporter:It is true that stability is important.

I am in the UK so we have socialised medicine :). Would you feel more comfortable if you lived in a country like that?\nseeker:lol definitely!

I'm really lonely and kind of sad.\nsupporter:I'm so sorry to hear that.\nsupporter:Do you mind me asking what is going on that is making you feel this way?\nseeker:Thank you. I broke up with my girlfriend. It was the right thing to do, but now I'm really lonely and sad.\nsupporter:I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds to me like you're having a hard time dealing with the emotions that you're dealing with after having broken up with your girlfriend. Does this sound right?\nseeker:Yes, that's right. It's been really hard.\nsupporter:I can tell that you're really struggling.\nseeker:Thank you. I was with her for about a year. It was good at first, of course.\nsupporter:I've dealt with these emotions myself. I recently broke up with my now ex-boyfriend. I have been feeling these same emotions.\nseeker:I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? The loneliness gets so hard, especially when you just want to tell something to someone.\nsupporter:I know it feels terrible, but I think that you reaching out for support is a great first step! I'm really proud of you! You will get through this!\nseeker:Thank you. Honestly, I'm glad you're there to reach out to.\nsupporter:We were together for about 5 years. Yes, the loneliness does get very hard.\nsupporter:I'm happy that I can be here to help you and so that you have someone to talk to! I promise to do my best!\nseeker:Oh wow, that's a long time. And thanks. I appreciate your optimism! I am usually very upbeat and optimistic myself.\nseeker:Thank you. I really appreciate it. Hopefully I can help you somehow too.\nsupporter:After my breakup, I found that the best thing to do was to involve myself in other activities that I enjoyed in order to take my mind off of the negative feelings that I was dealing with.\nseeker:The shiba inu in my profile circle is making me smile. I used to have a shiba inu. :)\nsupporter:You seem very kind! I appreciate your willingness to be here for and to listen to me as well!\nsupporter:Aww! That makes me happy to hear that seeing my profile picture is making you smile!\nseeker:That sounds really smart. I've been trying to do that. Of course with a pandemic going on it's more difficult.\nsupporter:Have you considered getting into any hobbies to take your mind off of what's going on?\nseeker:No no... my profile picture. Yours shows up as a squirrel. lol\nseeker:I usually hike a lot, but my hiking groups aren't going out right now.\nsupporter:Oh! I'm so sorry! Haha!\nsupporter:Have you considered things like journaling, reading, or arts and crafts?\nseeker:Maybe I should get a pet squirrel?\nseeker:Yes, I actually read and write quite a bit. Especially for work. That's not overly therapeutic, but it helps nonetheless.\nsupporter:That may not be a bad idea! If you really like them and are able to properly care for it, animals can be very therapeutic!\nseeker:I have one dog who isn't much bigger than a squirrel. She has been an invaluable companion.\nsupporter:Writing and reading have been proven to be extremely therapeutic. I used to write down my feelings on a piece of paper and then destroy it (throw it away) once I was done. There's something about it that really seems to help.\nsupporter:Aww! That sounds like an adorable dog! What breed of dog is she? I have two cats myself. They make me feel better on a daily basis!\nseeker:I've tried to keep a journal but I never stick to it. I find that writing letters to friends serves me the same purpose, and it helps me to stay connected, too. Plus, people love getting real, hand-written mail.\nseeker:She is a miniature dachshund. Today she went to the bank with me, and all of the tellers came to the window to look into the car at her. lol  I like cats too. Animals are so healing.\nsupporter:That sounds like a great idea! I love the fact that it helps you to stay connected, especially considering (as you already mentioned) that it's difficult to connect right now since we're dealing with COVID-19.\nsupporter:I love that you're telling me about your dog and how all of the people at the bank wanted to see her! I bet that made you feel much better.\nseeker:Yeah, and you're right. There's something therapeutic and cathartic about hand writing that typing does not replicate.\nseeker:Yes, it made me happy to see them fawning over her. And it made her happy because they gave her treats.\nseeker:Dealing with issues during Covid is so rough.\nsupporter:I couldn't agree more. Dealing with COVID on top of everything else has been extremely difficult for me. Honestly, I think it is part of what caused a lot of the issues that I'm currently dealing with.\nseeker:I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes.\nsupporter:It makes me happy to hear that you know that you're better off. I know it's sad, but accepting that a relationship wasn't meant to be is, in my opinion, the first step to truly getting over someone. A year is a long time to spend with one person.\nseeker:I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders.\nseeker:So is five years!

I wish I could get over it. I can't get her off my mind. She's dating this total loser.\nsupporter:That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little?

Some guys just aren't that way.\nsupporter:I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!\nseeker:That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself.  I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.\nsupporter:Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways.\nsupporter:Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?\nseeker:That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is.\nseeker:I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships.\nsupporter:That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself\nseeker:What do you think I could do to improve myself?\nsupporter:I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you\nsupporter:If you change who you are, it sort of means that your ex still has a hold on you, you know?\nseeker:Will the same problems show up in the next relationship though? It could be a long search before I find someone that matches with me?\nseeker:That's true. But I feel like I should take away something from this experience.\nsupporter:I guess that depends on you, would you rather compromise for a relationship or find one who'll really last and not have to change?\nseeker:I think all relationships require compromise and change. No two people are perfectly compatible.\nseeker:I worry that I have blind spots that I should fix. My ex-GF didn't really specify what the problem was.\nsupporter:That's true, building on that, you could also say that what your ex found to be the problem is not the be-all end-all. What your ex disliked could be what 10000 other girls love in a guy\nseeker:That's true. I might end up trying to solve a problem that really isn't there.

Is this your husband/boyfriend?\nseeker:he is my boyfriend but we have been together for 6 years, and since his car wreck and him being diagnosed with tbi he hasnt been him self lately! and it seems like he has been getting worse!\nsupporter:That's a long time. He's lucky to have you to support him. You said you worry when he's not at home. Is this because of the injury and not acting like himself?\nsupporter:Supporting someone with a  brain injury can be stressful. Are you taking are of yourself as well? You can't be of help to your boyfriend if you are not doing well yourself.\nseeker:well yes but no, he got in a car accident on 9/6/2018 and i fall pregnant exactly a year later my due date was 9/4/2019 but i had her 8/22/19 and\nseeker:i was going to say alot more but it wouldnt let me so i copied it but it wont let me paste it so im not even going to try to type all of that up agin lol\nseeker:but long story shot he cheated on me a half a year after i had my daughter and now the girl is pregnant wanting \nme to take in her child bc its either her life or the babys and me being the person i am i ant let the baby go into foster care or my baby not being able to see her sibling\nsupporter:If I understand this correctly your boyfriend cheated on you after you had a child together. Now, the other woman is pregnant with your boyfriends baby? Did I get that right?\nseeker:yep its a very frustrating and difficut situation\nsupporter:I can understand that would make you feel anxious and depressed.\nsupporter:Do you have someone to help you cope with this situation? Friends, Family, etc?\nseeker:what would u do or how would u feel if u was in this situation? i ended up getting back with him bc i didnt want my child without a father like i was\nsupporter:I totally understand where you are coming from.\nsupporter:Things get much more complicated when children are involved.\nseeker:nope i keep to myself! and alot of friends and family dont even know shes pregnant with his kid yet, \nbut yes at the time i had help\nseeker:yes it does get alot more complicated exp \nwhen my kid is involed and then i have to thing about him not being himself bc of his tbo\nsupporter:Well, it sounds like you still have a lot going on. Sometimes even when you want to take more on emotionally and mentally you need to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation.\nsupporter:Maybe finding someone to talk to about everything that is currently going on in your life would be helpful.\nsupporter:Youre only human, right?\nseeker:yea i know,but thats hard when u dont know how to deal with the situation and when u meet someone that u just can stay mad at\nsupporter:Agreed. But maybe that's what has to happen to help you get through this.\nsupporter:I think it might be a good starting point for you.\nseeker:i know, im trying to work on that! i forgive to easily\nsupporter:That's okay. Forgiveness helps us out as well.

I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.\nseeker:Do you have any other suggestions for those busy days when I am non-stop?\nsupporter:I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.\nseeker:Maybe I can get my friends to go for an early morning walk before I start the pressures of the day.  That might work to help me stay calmer.\nsupporter:I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too. That can be a great motivator.\nseeker:Do you have any other suggestions on what could maybe make up for one or two \"B\" grades?  It's hard to be perfect, but these programs are demanding.\nsupporter:Indeed it is hard to be perfect and no one is. It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself.

I'm just having a hard time.\nsupporter:Is there something that you'd like to talk about?\nseeker:It's mainly my husband. His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself.\nsupporter:Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?\nseeker:I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself.\nsupporter:So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?\nseeker:Exactly. And if I push further, he compares himself to other people: \"Well, at least I don't hit you.\" or \"At least I'm not an alcoholic\" Like I should thank him for existing.\nsupporter:It sounds like a really toxic relationship - I hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end I felt that I had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though.\nseeker:It's hard because we have children. When we were just dating, he was a different person. He didn't start to act this way until after our eldest was born.\nsupporter:Ah, unfortunately a lot of men are like that - before you become seriously committed they seem totally different. Have you considered seeking professional help?\nseeker:The problem all boils down to money. If I had enough for therapy I wouldn't be worried about his spending habits! lol. But, you're right, that's probably what we both need!\nsupporter:I believe that there are some organisations that will offer free therapy sessions for people in need. Have you considered asking your doctor?\nseeker:Really? I'd definitely be interested in that. Do they have online therapy like that?\nsupporter:I am not totally sure what is available but I think that there might be such things\nseeker:Thanks for your help. You said you've been in similar relationships. Is this behavior common for men?\nsupporter:Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, however, there are some bad apples who give all men a bad name. I am sure that the same applies to women too though!\nseeker:Haha, true. I just wondered. I had previous relationships, but they were very short.  My dad was always the opposite: he was a penny-pincher. Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just to stingy with the money, but then I remember that we have none, so Idk how to be more generous lol\nsupporter:You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish.\nseeker:Thank you for your help and feedback.

Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.\nsupporter:One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.\nseeker:Yes, I could not agree with you more. Specially now that I have tapped into my savings and retirement. Never in life did I think I would worry about paying my light bill.\nsupporter:It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.\nseeker:Thank you for the kind words. I have control of some aspects. Perhaps I will apply for an additional job, just to ensure I have a steady income. Thank you for the guidance. If you dont have any other advice we can end our interchange after this reply.\nsupporter:I just wanted to remind you to remember, anxiety about something that has not happened yet is not always helpful to yourself. By focusing directly on what you can do, you can make sure you are prepared for anything negative coming your way.\nseeker:Thank you, I will keep that in mind.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

You should look out for yourself!\nseeker:True, I definitely do not need to be caught up in her mess.  I have too much to lose.

I can still try even if I feel nervous.  You really do not need confidence to put your resume out there, you just need to do it afraid. And when I \"do it afraid\" I realize it was easier than I thought.\nseeker:\"Do it afraid\"? Do you mean do it even if I am afraid? It sounds a bit too optimistic to me.\nsupporter:I used to be paralyzed with self confidence, but the truth is, your confidence doesn't come from your job, your confidence comes from being a lovable person. The confidence that you are the person you want to be.\nsupporter:It sounds optimistic but it is the truth, when I step out to perform, I'm always nervous. BEING nervous looking for a job, that is NORMAL. To expect to feel like you are super confident is unrealistic. Most people are nervous, but they do it anyway.\nseeker:Ok, I think it makes sense. I may have to give it a try.\nsupporter:I always felt awkward and nervous looking for a job, I think I went to one interview calm and cool, in 30 years!

Just that I need to be at a higher pay to reach some financial goals\nsupporter:You have nothing to lose, really, you have weighed out that there is only good things that can come, but you think you must \"feel\" a certain way. You don not have to feel confident, you just have to do the work. For example, you don't FEEL like walking your dog, changing a diaper or helping someone, but you DO IT anyway.\nseeker:Cool! I will try to get motivated and start applying. Your words are just what I needed in this gloomy atmosphere.\nsupporter:Inter personal skills can be learned. I was very shy as a child and I learned how to be more friendly. And I was VERY shy.\nseeker:Ya, I think the key is to keep my current job and start looking elsewhere.\nseeker:Last time I made a grave mistake of quitting my job and then searching! I was very new, and over confident\nsupporter:I'm very outgoing now. I had to learn a lot of skills to be this way and I like myself more too. Hahah. I'm old though, 59.

And their help isn't always the best, or the type of support I am looking for.\nsupporter:I can see how that would be difficult.\nsupporter:Maybe if there is something specific  you need help with, you could ask a coworker or senior staff.\nseeker:Yeah, it has been very difficult. Do you have any reccomendations? Or what would you do in the situation?\nseeker:I generally do do that. Sometimes I get the help I need, others not so much. So i feel like im second guessing myself a lot, which puts me under a lot of stress.\nsupporter:Since you are relatively new it is understandable that it may be difficult.

What would i do then?\nsupporter:Is there something specific you are feeling you need more help with?  Maybe the people you are asking do not understand exactly what  you need help with.\nseeker:Decision making and the little details are where I am struggling. I've had adequate training, but i still feel as though I lack the expertise needed to do my job well. Someimtes I get the support I need, and other times i don't. I'm wondering what i should do in times where I am not getting the support I need if its not available.\nsupporter:That is understandable.  I have been in situations where I had to make difficult decisions at my job too.  Overtime you will be gaining experience and it will most likely get easier or you'll get better.\nseeker:Yeah, you're right. I think it will just take time for me to get comfortable and gain confidence in my abilities.\nsupporter:If there are situations you've found difficult, maybe you could practice making decisions in those circumstances, or ask coworkers what they have done in those times as well.\nseeker:That is a great suggestion\nsupporter:You seem to care about this job and your performance.

I've worked for this person for several years. Felt I've done a really good job. Gone above and beyond but my evaluations always come back as just meets expectations. Nothing more. Just fond out he's hiring someone new to train to take over his job when he retires.\nsupporter:You must have your sites set on the position as well. That can be frustrating\nsupporter:Can I ask how many others work with you\nseeker:It would have been nice to have been considered. At least been in the conversation.

His way or no way.\nsupporter:Are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time\nsupporter:There is no reason to be petty. You have a legitimate reasoning to your feelings\nseeker:I think may be because my approach to things are a little more subtle. I tend to get a long with people in different departments more than he does. I'm \"not aggressive enough\" he's said in the past.

I stepped away from the computer for a moment while waiting...\nsupporter:That's quite all right. The wait times can be a bit long. How are you?\nseeker:Well, my manager has decided that everyone in the office will continue to work from after the pandemic is under control. But I've found myself depressed from working from home all the time.\nsupporter:Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?\nseeker:For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :(\nsupporter:Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.\nseeker:That's where it gets awkward. It seems like everyone besides me are super happy that we'll continue working from home. I hesitate to share my feelings because maybe my manager will change her mind, which would be a big bummer for everyone else on the team (seemingly).\nsupporter:I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?\nseeker:Well, it's possible that my manager will say we can be flexible. But if so, I think I'd end up being the only one in my office working... which would be just as lonely as working from home while throwing away the few perks of working from home, like saving on gas. Plus, I think my company will probably want to repurpose our office space eventually.\nseeker:lol, sorry, that was an ugly run-on sentence. :\\\nsupporter:Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies.\nsupporter:Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well.\nseeker:That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic. So it kind of feels like this might be a \"cultural shift\" in my area in general. Although there has GOT to be a whole lot of other people who feel like I do. Maybe we should start our own company, lol.\nsupporter:True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space?\nseeker:That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down.

How come so tired?\nseeker:Because I can't sleep... I don't know what's wrong with me I just lay there awake for hours!\nsupporter:Oh I have had trouble sleeping before!   Would you like to know what helped me?\nseeker:Yes please, I'm desperate, I'll try anything!\nsupporter:First of all, fixed sleep and wake times.   If you toss and turn for hours, still get up at the same time.   Eventually your body will tire and sleeping will naturally become easier.\nseeker:I have to always get up for work so I am sticking to the same routines, I just lie in bed with so many thoughts racing around my head and I just can't get off to sleep\nsupporter:Second thing I do is I have a wind down routine.   No work past a certain time, no matter what.   Only soft music, pleasant movie, some light reading, and dim the lights.   It slows your body down before sleep.  It will help slow that racing thoughts you are having.\nseeker:I did try reading a book last night, but I don't really have lights that I can dim, it's just the one bright light in our room.\nsupporter:I have had racing thoughts and it used to drive me up the wall!\nsupporter:Can you buy a lamp?  Even a second hand one if your budget is tight?\nseeker:Yeah, it's just so annoying and then I'm so tired and irritable the next day, I find myself snapping at everyone.\nsupporter:The bright light will keep your mind stimulated.\nseeker:I could buy a lamp I suppose, to see if it helps? But when I am awake all night it's in the dark so I'm not sure if the light is the problem>\nsupporter:Aw so you are so exhausted from racing thoughts and not enough sleep the night before that you end up taking it out on others, but not meaning to.  Am I understanding correctly?\nsupporter:Do you get any exercise?  I sleep better on days I go for walks, and my sedentary days I sleep worse, it's quite clear to me.\nseeker:I have been trying to do lots of walks, I need to lose weight as well so they kind of go hand in hand!\nseeker:I do also have back pain so that's another thing that doesn't help!\nsupporter:Good effort, keep it up!\nsupporter:Back pain, I know all about that too unfortunately.  How is your mattress?\nseeker:Yeah it's a pretty good mattress, but it is a few years old now, I'm not sure how often you're supposed to replace them?\nsupporter:Hmm I can't recall, I can't afford to replace mine regularly enough lol.  Maybe google it?\nseeker:Yeah maybe, at this point it's worth looking into anything that could help!\nsupporter:Do you have someone to talk to about the thoughts that are racing?\nsupporter:If they are worries, maybe a counsellor would help.\nseeker:Not really, I don't really have any friends and my boyfriends a bit weird about stuff like this, I can't really talk to him about things like this.\nseeker:Yeah maybe, I have been considering a counsellor myself.\nsupporter:Hmm that's a challenge not having friends.   Have been there too!\nseeker:And I don't know how to go about finding new ones! I don't think I'm someone people like to be friends with, I try to make friends but they always move on.\nsupporter:I don't want to give you a huge barrage of suggestions but another thing that helps me is a podcast called Tracks to Relax.\nseeker:Sounds interesting, I'll have to look it up!\nsupporter:Well maybe you just haven't met the right people yet.  It takes time finding someone we click with\nseeker:That's true, maybe they weren't meant to be my friends. Anyway, thank you so much for your help but I have to shoot off.\nsupporter:It's probably not you!

It can be hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel when we are depressed.\nseeker:I live close to my sister as well but it is still difficult for me to even talk a lot to them\nsupporter:Oh that's great you have a supportive wife!\nseeker:I feel like I don't have anyone sometimes and she is supportive but I just get to feeling down and shutdown\nsupporter:In my community we have mental health programs, I am actually doing some via zoom, do you know if there is anything like that you can access?\nseeker:I shutdown from everything and feel worthless sometimes\nsupporter:I understand that shut down feeling....I close right up when I am down\nseeker:I hate to feel like that but I feel there is nothing I can do sometimes\nsupporter:Feeling worthless, uninterested in going out, those are symptoms of depression, they will pass\nseeker:I don't find fun in things I used to do that was fun\nseeker:I feel so separated from people my parents both are gone now too\nsupporter:Lack of interest in things is also a symptom of depression.   Once your depression lifts it will come back.   I'll tell you what helped me when I was depresed...\nseeker:My dad passed away 24 years ago and my mom passed away last easter too\nseeker:what helped you?\nsupporter:I was taught to make very small goals.  For example, I found it hard to go out for a walk, even though I knew it would help my depression. (Exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidpressants)  So I was told, just walk around the block.  If that's too much, walk to the corner.   If that's too much, walk to the end f the driveway.  If that's too much, step outside.   If that's too much, put your shoes on.

It makes the isolation all the harder trying to handle the grief. It does help to talk, thank you.

Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas.\nsupporter:Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse.\nseeker:When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone.

I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us.\nsupporter:Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?\nseeker:Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that.\nsupporter:Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately.\nseeker:Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone.\nsupporter:I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?\nseeker:I have a brother, but his wife is really terrible, and they are very close. He and I text some, and I try to keep that up. He doesn't need me the way I need him...\nsupporter:What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free\nseeker:Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video...\nsupporter:That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?\nseeker:The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization.\nsupporter:Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have.\nseeker:If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups...\nseeker:Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start?\nsupporter:There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?\nsupporter:I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you.\nseeker:Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet.

Do you think that is why you feel depressed?\nseeker:I don't think so\nseeker:The thing is, I'm still friends with her\nsupporter:So that is good, that even after the end of your romantic relationship you were still able to maintain a friendship.\nseeker:It's rather awkward, tho.

No longer supervising anyone, only doing grunt work, etc. It ticks me off and there's nothing I can do about it.\nseeker:I'm working on a *possible* action - RETIREMENT from this job. Only problem is - bad time to be doing that; pressure to keep my income up until my daughter graduates college, etc.\nsupporter:That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization.\nsupporter:That's positive, though, that you at least have a strategy in mind with retirement, even if this may not be the best time right now.\nseeker:She has a \"plan\", I guess, but it isn't being articulated that well, and these actions are demonstrating poor \"people management\" and seem to be both confusing lots of folks, and professionally insulting many others. Oh, and by the way, things are running WORSE than they were before, but it's being blamed on COVID\nseeker:Problem with the \"retirement strategy\" is that it means going out on a limb with no job with the holidays coming up, and with COVID with no end in sight. SO, just \"muddling through\" the days these days, hoping better times are ahead.\nsupporter:It sounds like you are not the only worker who is seriously questioning the changes being made.\nseeker:Oh, no. 1 person outright quit immediately. 1 other has retired already. 1 more I know is retiring by New Years. Others are more \"stuck\", as they just CAN'T afford to quit OR retire. So, yeah, us \"old folk\" are not \"happy campers\"\nsupporter:Wow! From what you've said, it sounds like your coworkers feel much as you do about the changes.\nseeker:Yep. We are sort of our own \"support group\", but since we are all 100% teleworking these days, we don't \"see\" each other, though we try to touch base through phone calls at least once a week.\nsupporter:That must be tough, but it must help to at least commiserate through the phone calls and be able to relate to each other.\nseeker:Yep. Best I can hope for at this point. If I find another job to transition to, that would improve things. Until then, gotta just \"keep on keeping on\"\nsupporter:My former spouse works for a company that has moved him to departments he needed to retrain to work in, and he is considering looking for a different job, maybe after COVID is outta here.\nsupporter:It sounds like you're determined to stay as positive as possible while considering other options, such as a new job. Doing something about it like this must feel a little better.\nseeker:As good as it can. Thanks for your time and commiseration.\nsupporter:You're welcome! I also think that's wise to hold off on retirement until your daughter is through college. My oldest is ready for college and I don't feel ready to leave work, either.\nseeker:Yep, and she's actually a senior, so she'll graduate in May.

But luckily, you have resources and support. Help me understand what makes you drink? Is it a trigger like stress? Or just a habit?\nseeker:Work has been stressful, but I feel like was before things got bad. Most nights I come home to drink so that I can forget about my day.\nsupporter:What do you do for work?\nseeker:I work in finance at a large corporation.\nsupporter:Oh I can definitely understand your reasoning. I am not justifying your behavior, but at least we see now, it goes hand in hand. The corporate dinner parties and cocktail hours.. it is usually much deeper than the surface\nseeker:Hmm. I never thought of it that way.\nseeker:I guess maybe I need to look into how such events affect me.\nsupporter:Usually when I find myself going off the deep end, I can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. My control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. It does not have to be a contest. It should make you feel good, then leave it. But if you cannot control it, try and de-stress another way like baths or massages\nsupporter:It sounds like you are pretty self aware, which is a great short cut to this dilemma.\nsupporter:You can use this to your advantage, and make more conscious choices to better your life\nseeker:Yeah, that makes sense.\nseeker:I think I understand the problem I have much better now.\nsupporter:That is great, please share with me your findings\nseeker:Honestly, I don't feel like I fit in at my job. I get concerned that my coworkers like me better after I've had a few drinks and loosened up a bit. But there's been more stress lately and I've been pushing it a lot more.\nsupporter:It is easy to get side tracked by ego especially in that field. Try to stay focused and remember why you are there. You aren't there to impress Jim. You are there to make money and achieve your goals. As long as your eyes stay on the goal, the rest will follow.\nseeker:Yeah. That makes sense.

And his?\nseeker:MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six.\nseeker:This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too.\nseeker:His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out.\nsupporter:Yes, I can imagine that it is.

I have a final coming up after next week.\nsupporter:School can be very demanding. What has you stressed?\nseeker:yeah just trying to speed through the readings as I still have more than a few units to read through\nsupporter:All nighters can be rough. Do you have snacks and caffeine?\nseeker:and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, \nand another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month.\nseeker:yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee.\nseeker:I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc.\nseeker:it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess\nsupporter:You can master it within in a month, you are already getting a head start\nseeker:yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind.\nseeker:just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings\nsupporter:Yes the pandemic has created a lot of challenges for routines and schedules\nseeker:plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course.\nseeker:yeah it sure has.\nseeker:I can go on and on about that too\nsupporter:I am confident you can succeed, it sounds like you have a plan and dedication\nseeker:And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately.\nseeker:thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic.\nsupporter:That is a tough cycle to break.\nseeker:yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started.\nsupporter:I think you're saying you will have go put your nose to the grind\nseeker:so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses.\nseeker:and get back to some normalcy in my life routines.\nseeker:it will literally be a fresh start, next january\nsupporter:Yes, definitely allow yourself time to breathe\nseeker:yeah exactly, nose to the grind\nseeker:yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc.\nsupporter:I think you sound very capable, despite the amount of stress you're under\nseeker:its all linked and most of it is due to the pandemic and the studies is just a reinforcement of this loop, fuels it actually.\nsupporter:You can get back on track with those healthy behaviors\nseeker:Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again.\nseeker:Thank you for your advice\nseeker:I hope I can break my bad cycles like I said.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

What can I help you with today?\nseeker:Hello every since I lost my job I have felt sad and useless\nsupporter:That is an extremely tough situation to go through, I'm sorry to hear that.\nseeker:Application after application I get rejected, it makes it hard to even fill out more\nsupporter:Yes, job applications can feel particularly demeaning to complete.  Personally, I get frustrated with all the repetition and then repetitive rejection.  It seems like I had no value.\nsupporter:But you have to consider that there are dozens of different reasons why you don't get selected for a job, and quite a few of them have nothing to do with you , either as a person or as an employee.\nseeker:It feels good someone else knows how frustrating and what a cycle it creates but I am also sorry that you do know how it is also.\nseeker:Thank you for that, it seems most of the jobs I am applying for I am over qualified for which doesn't make sense to me and makes me think it is something personal about me.\nsupporter:No, don't think that.  I know of several employers that have actually said they don't want employees smarter than them.  It requires more money and more management, and quite a few people are very happy to not do either of those things for ostensibly higher quality workforce.\nsupporter:On an actionable level, have you been getting blocked at the application point or the interviewing point?\nseeker:Hopefully I find an employer that sees a quality workforce over other things, its getting pretty discouraging\nseeker:I seem to be getting blocked at application level for employment, it seems my skills are mostly being put out to contract work now, which is not something I am familiar with.\nsupporter:I see.  Maybe there are some qualification programs in your local area, or maybe at the local university or college where you could take classes?  There is a career development center at my local university that is open to everyone, maybe you could see if they would review your resume and give you some objective feedback?  Students love a good live subject :-)\nseeker:Wow I have never thought about that! That sounds awesome and like it would be great help, also trying something new would feel nice instead of filing the same stuff into applications!\nsupporter:You should explore what resources your city/county/province may offer for job seekers.  It is in the best interest of almost every community that its members have have jobs and feel useful, so you may find some valuable information and maybe some connections.\nsupporter:Oh!  And what I always tell everyone who is looking for a job:  Apply UP!  Don't ever think is something above your level.  Apply UP!  They may admire your temerity and invite you for an interview just to see who you think you are :-)\nseeker:My spirits are going up just having this conversation and looking forward to the community outreach. Hopefully it helps lift this gloom that has been over me for months. I loved my previous job but due to bad management it was taking a toll on everyone employed.\nsupporter:I am glad to hear you are feeling a little better!  Yes, bad management is so toxic.

I wonder how I can get through to him to really let him know I'm serious.

Unfortunately we live on the same street so it's kind of hard not to run into each other. :/\nsupporter:That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough\nseeker:Right, so basically let him know if he continues to act like he does, we're done as friends, correct? Or should I not be that bold?\nsupporter:Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance. If he still doesn't respect your words, it's the best for both to say it clearly.\nseeker:Sounds good, I'm looking forward to getting this resolved.

I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though.\nsupporter:True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays.\nsupporter:Did you have plans this weekend?\nseeker:No.  My nearby friends all went away for the holidays.  I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself.\nsupporter:What kind of hobbies do you have?\nseeker:I'm teaching myself the piano.  I'm also teaching myself  how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer.  I also like to read novels.\nsupporter:I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word\nseeker:Yeah, it's pretty cool.  For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then \"Did there come a time\" will appear in English on my machine's  LCD screen.\nsupporter:Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds?\nseeker:Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno.  This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.\nsupporter:OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user.

We have no close friends and family near us, we moved here to a very rural area in KY some years ago, so I understand.\nsupporter:Do you live alone?\nseeker:Yeah I do\nsupporter:One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person.\nseeker:How did you meet them online?\nsupporter:On FB in groups.

I am a woman, so I just picked women.\nseeker:I feel like I would struggle to establish a connection with someone over the phone.

We never even got around to putting our finances together.  So I'm good there.  Thank goodness\nsupporter:She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!\nseeker:No and it shocks me because she was so against not getting a divorce.  We think (her bff and sister) that she may be using drugs.\nsupporter:Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, I believe. Would you consider them?\nseeker:I would.  She won't even talk to me though.

She has never said or showed it\nsupporter:Sometimes, unfortunately, you do just have to walk away from a mess if there's nothing you can do about it\nseeker:I know.  I'm struggling with letting go of her.  It's like my brain is consumed with the thoughts.  I want to let her go.  I just love her so much.  I would of never married her if I wasn't in it till the end.\nsupporter:I hear you on that. Unfortunately some people do not take commitment as seriously as others. I have been in that position and had my heart broken.\nseeker:Yes I agree with that.  How did you get over it?\nseeker:I feel like she just turned her feelings for me off.  She blocked me on all social media and my number.  Then again I'm sure the potential drugs could help with her turning her feelings off\nsupporter:Oh, I tracked him down and smashed his head in with an axe. Okay no I didn't really.

It's just sucks, and that's okay\nseeker:It's perseverance through hardship that make you grateful in the end, but the process still sucks.\nsupporter:I guess in a way this whole thing has been an eyeopener for you. Are you considering moving back home when this is over?\nseeker:Haha no way that place sucks. :)\nseeker:I love where I've moved, it's lonely for now, but the small taste I got of the town when I first moved is enough to stay for.\nseeker:We'll see what the future brings.\nsupporter:Very true about perseverance. I think everyone is feeling a bit depressed at this point.\nseeker:It's very easy to. Just watching old videos with crowds of people is so strange and nostalgic\nsupporter:You seem to have a good mindset about everything.

I don't have any motivation to do anything and I'm not sure exactly where to turn.\nsupporter:it sounds like you are a little depressed\nseeker:I think that might be true.

He's great, but it's just not the same as having a friend to turn to.  I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk.\nsupporter:I feel a lot of people are in your situation especially with Covid going on.  Do you connect with friends on social media at all (like facebook)?\nseeker:Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there.  I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping.  I think I am just feeling fatigued of being stuck inside, which makes me feel sad about everything else.\nsupporter:I can totally understand where you are coming from.  I think it is great that you are at least getting a little communication with facebook.  I am guessing you will be in line for a vaccination also in the up coming month which I think will help your mood as well.\nseeker:Yes, I am awaiting my turn for the vaccine and I am very much looking forward to getting it so I can get back to some normalcy.  I miss being able to go shopping or sitting in a coffee shop.  These activities helped me in the past, so I look forward to being able to get out and do them again.  I used to visit my friends too and we'd have lunch or coffee at their house, but obviously I haven't been able to do that lately.  I will be able to once I get the vaccine.\nsupporter:I was able to get my first dose of this vaccine this past Sunday.  I was very surprised how good I felt this week like a weight being lifted off my shoulders.  I work with high school kids so it was nice not thinking about covid all the time.  I not it might not help for you today but I think it will give you something to look forward as you move forward in the upcoming weeks.\nsupporter:*I know\nseeker:That's so exciting for you!  I am hoping I will be able to get mine in the coming weeks.  I've definitely been looking forward to getting it.  I decided a week ago that I would get a puppy as a companion.  So I am looking forward to that, but he will not be coming home until the beginning of May.  But you're right I need to look forward to the things that will bring me happiness even though it's hard right now.\nsupporter:Absolutely.  The weather seems to be getting nicer as well.  Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)?\nseeker:I love walking outside.  We had a 60 degree day not too long ago and I went outside immediately to walk.  My mood was better that day than it has been in months.  I am definitely looking forward to spring, which is quickly approaching now!  I have to say, I appreciate you pushing me in the direction of thinking positively and looking forward to the future, it's something I definitely lost my grasp on for a little while.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

My fiance died four years ago today and I am very sad.\nsupporter:I am sorry to hear about your loss. How do you feel throughout the day?\nseeker:Very sad.  I think about him often.\nsupporter:It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.\nseeker:Yes but how much time?\nsupporter:Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.\nseeker:I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him.\nsupporter:I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.\nseeker:Yes, I do try.  Thank you.\nseeker:May I ask what helped you move forward?\nsupporter:I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?\nseeker:Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him.\nseeker:But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle.\nsupporter:That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?\nseeker:actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you.\nseeker:i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well.\nsupporter:Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.\nseeker:i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself.\nseeker:I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.

Sometimes it's just in my own head.\nseeker:I don't know how to explain. I have a feeling everybody even on the street are laughing because of my breakup with partner.\nsupporter:i see\nsupporter:but HAS anyone laughted at you?  or told you they don't like you?  or not responded when you have talked to them?\nseeker:No, not really. I think it's just my feelings about it. Because you know my ex on a public was so perfect but nobody knows how she acted when we were alone...\nsupporter:i can relate to this.   I went through a breakup a couple of years ago, and left town.   Part of me is relieved I don't have to see those friends we had in common any more.  I didn't want to be jiudged for leaving him.   So I have experienced some similar feelings.\nseeker:Good you understand me\nsupporter:Ah yes, the public and private can be quite different sometimes for sure\nsupporter:have you reached out to any of these friends to test the waters?  maybe called or texted just to touch base and have a chat that's not emotionally loaded, about light topics?   This might be a non-threatening way to test out how they are feelng about you.  You might be pleasantly surprised, and find that goes well.\nseeker:One friend offered me to go for a drink tonight but I haven't replied yet. And also I don't want to talk about my ex at all, that's what I am afraid he can ask.\nsupporter:the other thing is these common friends might feel a bit awkard too about the situation.   They have to figure out how to relate to you both on your own, it's a change of dynamics, so might take a bit of time to settle out.   Can you tell your friend that you'd like to go out for a drink but that you don't feel comfortable talking about your ex at all?  Would your friend respect your request if you made one do you think?\nseeker:Yes that's true. I believe he might understand me and accept my request. Would be quite challenging if we will meet my ex wth other friends in same pub. I live in a small town.\nsupporter:oh I see, yes that could be awkward for sure.\nsupporter:i think it's important you go out with your friend, but can understand your reluctance to run into your ex.

Anyone there?\nseeker:Hi sorry\nseeker:I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis\nsupporter:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?\nseeker:In about a month.\nsupporter:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.\nsupporter:Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?\nseeker:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.\nsupporter:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.\nsupporter:Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.\nseeker:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\nsupporter:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.\nsupporter:Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.\nseeker:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\nsupporter:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that\nsupporter:You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.\nsupporter:That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.\nseeker:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.\nsupporter:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.\nsupporter:Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.\nseeker:My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable.\nsupporter:Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!\nseeker:I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake.\nsupporter:It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!\nseeker:That sounds like a wonderful feeling. But so far away.\nsupporter:My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.\nseeker:That's a very poetic way of putting it.\nsupporter:Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at.\nseeker:I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help.\nsupporter:I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Also depending how old you are some therapists work on a sliding scale or wave fees if you cant afford it.\nsupporter:The counselor may be able to act as a mediator between you and your parents.\nseeker:That's great. it will definitely ease some tensions\nsupporter:I wouldnt hold off to long as these types of problems tend to brew and just get stronger.

I just want a normal adult job, you know? I went to college, so it shouldn't be that hard.\nsupporter:Of course! Everyone deserves to have a job that they worked hard for. What kind of jobs are you interested in?\nseeker:I like museum jobs or jobs that work with animals, but all of those require years of experience that I can't get because no one will hire me\nsupporter:Oh okay, well while looking for job try not to put yourself in position where you take deep breaths and let your mind at piece. Patience is everything. Sometime in life we all have our patience tested, but that is OK because at the end the results are better than anything.\nsupporter:I mean try to put yourself in that position.\nseeker:That is true. Maybe it just isn't the right time. Maybe I need to learn something before I find a job that I need to do\nsupporter:Of course! Everything comes at a perfect time, and we have to learn to be patient, and while waiting we can indulge in other activities that we like.\nsupporter:While doing your online job maybe you can work in activities that build experience for a job you want to do next time.\nseeker:I volunteer once a week with animals\nsupporter:That is a great idea! You are working hard and that hard work is going to pay off! Just try to relax and be patient, which can help with your stress.\nseeker:Thank you! I appreciate your comments.

Has he been putting pressure on you not to get the vaccine?\nseeker:yes\nseeker:i said \"lets agree to disagree\" but he could not accept that\nseeker:it's like he felt it was his duty to \"save me\"\nseeker:i feel disrespected, basically\nsupporter:I know it can be really frustrating. I 've had a friend like that before. Would cutting him out of your life make you more upset?\nseeker:i'm not sure...but i have...and i miss him!\nsupporter:Or would you like to continue the relationship, but maybe not now?\nsupporter:I think that's something you need to think about.\nsupporter:I mean he sounds kind of important to you that it's making you feel like this.\nseeker:i think maybe once covid blows over things might get back to where they were, i think that's what i want\nseeker:but part of me is just hurt and doesn't want something like this to happen again with him\nseeker:he is important to me, yes\nseeker:we have been friends for 20 years, he's one of my oldest friends\nsupporter:I really understand how you feel. Honestly the best thing I did was cool off a little and think how I want to take this friendship forward.\nseeker:you had a friend like this before you say?  how did you deal with it?\nseeker:as in what was the end result for you both, in your case? just curious\nseeker:i may email him but i'm not sure....i don't want it to end up being an argument, i don't have the mental energy for that...(covid situation has left me mentally depleted)\nsupporter:So I cut it off completely because she was starting to be destructive. She called me selfish because I did not want to hang out with her during COVID. We met up and talked about it, but she was out of hand and I quit the friendship.\nsupporter:But I think the best thing is to have some time alone and think about it.\nseeker:that's interesting....another covid-induced conflict\nsupporter:I know right.\nseeker:i like your idea of taking some time...that seems like a sensible path forward\nsupporter:Think about all the good and bad stuff that has happened between you two and see if it's worth keeping this friendship.\nsupporter:Don't really let your emotions take over. Think logically with a clear head.\nseeker:hmmm yes....maybe I will journal about it to get my thoughts clear\nseeker:okay\nsupporter:I hope this helped. You guys may see each other and forget all about it. Laugh about it later.\nseeker:i can't figure out if covid has brought people together or torn them apart, honestly\nseeker:lol i hope you're right\nsupporter:I think it has been tearing people apart because of everyone's different beliefs.\nseeker:covid seems to have brought out a lot of strong feelings in some people\nseeker:i tend to think you are right....but early on people were rallying together it seemed....but that didn't last long\nsupporter:I also think staying in the house too long has really made us bored and tired and kind of out of our minds lol.\nseeker:maybe by fall society will become more cohesive again, what do you think?\nseeker:hahaha yes totally\nsupporter:I hope so. I'm starting kind of a new life and I want to get on with it.\nsupporter:I think we all want to get on with our lives\nseeker:oh really? what kind of a new life?\nsupporter:I'm really happy you are getting the vaccine.

That's my life : )\nsupporter:Ok so I was sore and kind of sick.\nseeker:wow lots of exciting things!   which vaccine did you end up getting?\nseeker:i'm expecting mine within the next couple of weeks, can't wait\nsupporter:I got pfizer which is the best from what I know. That and Moderna. Don't get any other kind.\nseeker:oh i won't....astrazenca became available for 55 plus yesterday....NO THANKS\nsupporter:If you're not afraid of needles go do it! I really encourage it!\nsupporter:Just have a lazy day afterwards with some warm soup and Netflix.\nseeker:well thank you for talking with me....you cheered me up and helped me put my friend situation into perspective....i'll take some time like you suggested to asses my friendship\nseeker:i don't mind needles...don't even care if i have a fever for a week...all totally worth it :)\nsupporter:No problem.

Good thing for Burger King!\nsupporter:Have you looked into any edulational or learning games?\nsupporter:There is nothing wrong with rewarding your child for doing good in school or getting thier work done! :)\nseeker:That is a good idea.  I wonder if they have one for vocabulary as that is the test tomorrow!  She says she loves them.\nseeker:I'll have to look!\nsupporter:I have done that with my kids.

I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.\nsupporter:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.\nsupporter:Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.\nseeker:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\nsupporter:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.\nsupporter:Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.\nseeker:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\nsupporter:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that\nsupporter:You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.\nsupporter:That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.\nseeker:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.\nsupporter:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Is this correct?\nseeker:That is correct.\nsupporter:Who is treating you badly? Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?\nseeker:My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess.\nsupporter:That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.\nseeker:Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better.\nsupporter:Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?\nseeker:I have tried many times.

Kinda having a rough day today.\nsupporter:I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?\nseeker:Sure.  It's coming up on 3 years next month that I lost my boyfriend in a car accident.  Its just really rough this time of year.\nsupporter:Oh I am so sorry to hear that. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for you.\nseeker:Extremely hard.  I remember that morning like it was yesterday.  He got killed within an hour after leaving the house on his way to work.\nsupporter:He was killed so soon after you last saw him?\nseeker:Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him.\nsupporter:Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!\nseeker:I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed.\nsupporter:Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?\nseeker:I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not.\nsupporter:I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor\nseeker:I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot.\nsupporter:Are you still in touch with his family and friends?\nseeker:I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back.\nsupporter:I think you should do things in your own time but I would recommend doing it again one day.\nseeker:I don't have any contact with his family.  I actually had to block them on all social media.  They are extremely religous.  Which there is nothing wrong with that.  But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them.  They couldn't accept him for who he was.  His biological father didn't have anything to do with him.  His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up.  He ended up living with his grandparents.  He finally had acceptance in my family.  He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol.\nsupporter:Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another.\nseeker:His family has been pretty horrible to me and my girls.  And I know it's because they have guilt for the way things were with their relationship.  They didn't even invite me and my girls to the burial of his ashes.\nsupporter:That is extremely offensive and I think you would have had the right to contest that.\nseeker:It's very sad.  Not what I wanted at all.  But they were really horrible to me and my girls.  I know he would not be happy that they have treated us so poorly.\nsupporter:I hope that you are able to come to terms with things in the near future. Please try and focus on your girls and not worry so much!\nseeker:His sisters went and cleaned out and took everything he had from the shop the day after the funeral.  Which really hurt.  The stuff he had there meant alot to me.\nsupporter:I think you should talk to someone about this. Maybe a lawyer? There must be something people can do to help.\nseeker:I hope I can too.  I just take everything day by day.  I start a new job this week and hopefully things will start looking up.  The last 3 years have been rough to say the least.\nsupporter:I have to wrap this up now but I wish you all the very best for the future. Please try and reach out to people for help!\nseeker:We weren't married. And of course he didn't have a will.  He was only 32.

If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!\nseeker:I know about a local dog park and think I will visit it today. That is a really good idea. I don't need a bike for that.\nsupporter:I'm glad to hear that! I hope you have a great time there! Research has also shown that spending time outside everyday is really good for our mental health.\nseeker:You are giving me something to think about that isn't related to the break up. I feel like a weight is sort of lifting off of me. I think I needed to talk and get some of my feelings on the table today.\nsupporter:If you are still interested in getting a bike, I'd say go for it too! Biking is a great stress relief and form of exercise that often makes me feel better.\nsupporter:I am so glad to hear that and am so happy you are talking to me is making you feel better.\nseeker:Yes, I really want to get one but since I don't have a lot of money right now I will waitr on that and go to the dog park instead. I also heard about yoga iin the park.\nsupporter:Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive.\nseeker:I am feeling like life still goes on and things are going on all around me. I am going to start seeing whats out there and trying to join in a little bit more. My dog is opening a door for me and with your encouragement too.\nsupporter:I am very glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I am here to listen.\nseeker:I was thinking about reading self help books or journaling but I was so down on myself.\nsupporter:Reading and journaling are also great tools to use. Even when you are feeling down it can be helpful to write down your feelings as a form of release.\nseeker:Thank you for all of your support and understanding today. I am going to journal and then head to the dog park and get some fresh air.\nsupporter:That sounds like a great plan.

I want to break up with my partner but not sure how, this is increasing my anxiety\nsupporter:I am sorry to hear that. I know it can be really stressful when you are considering a break up. How long have you thought about doing this?\nseeker:i've thought about this for the last year, things have been going downhill since. I think its starting to become noticible\nsupporter:That is a long time to think about something, so you have given it a lot of time and thought. Have you mentioned it to your partner?\nseeker:i tried to do it around 8 months ago but my partner convinced herself that it was because i was cheating on her. Her own insecurities put me under a lot of pressure to stay in the relationship to prove i wasn't\n having an affair\nsupporter:Sharing your feelings is important so thank you for making the effort today. It is not fair to prove a negative and that can be taxing. It sounds like you are a very patient person.\nseeker:I try to be patient, but i feel like i am wasting my life when i could be happy on my own or potentially with someone else in the future\nseeker:Im anxious about my daughter and my relationship with her if we split up\nsupporter:You have spent a great deal of time trying to make things right with your partner and you have used a great deal of effort to make it work. You are also a very loving parent who cares greatly.\nseeker:I know i need to be true to myself but its extremely difficult, i'm\n not sure how to start the process\nsupporter:Yes, you are right. My parents split up later in life and I was happy to see my dad happy. I understand that isn't everyone story though. Do you have any close family members you can talk to about this? Or close friends?\nseeker:unfortunately i pushed all my friends away for the sake of the relationship, again the insecurities meant i couldn't have my own time and space. I know my family would be supportive, but there are a lot of financial issues with divorce\n which worries me\nsupporter:Often times people turn to church or religion and support groups in order to connect with people from the same faith. Have you considered this avenue?\nseeker:Ive considered support groups, im a little embarrassed tho.  I don't\n think religion would be much help to me\nsupporter:I understand that you feel nervous about reaching out and thank you again for doing that here today. Sometimes close friends can be a good source of support. It can be hard repairing friendships though.\nseeker:Maybe i should reach out again?\nsupporter:Yes, I would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. Support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people.\nseeker:i just hope my daughter is young enough to be able to adapt to her parents splitting up\nsupporter:Children are resilient and want their parents happy ultimately. You are a thoughtful person. Thank you for sharing your feelings today and being open to ideas and possible ways forward.\nseeker:Thank you very much, you've\n given me a few options to consider on how to move forward.

What is your biggest problem at the moment?\nsupporter:Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended?\nseeker:When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced.\nseeker:That was in March.\nseeker:I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together.\nseeker:ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet.\nsupporter:Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this.\nseeker:I'm debating. I don't know what to do.\nseeker:I feel like a schmuck.\nseeker:He has such pretty words.\nsupporter:From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen.\nseeker:And he invests so much time and effort into us.\nseeker:I agree with you.\nseeker:My mind agrees.\nseeker:My stupid emotions are clouding things.\nsupporter:Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?\nseeker:I did.\nseeker:LOL\nsupporter:And he's still married?\nseeker:And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house)\nseeker:That was two weeks ago.\nseeker:So, yes, he is.\nseeker:Too soon to tell.\nsupporter:I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?\nseeker:I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner.\nsupporter:It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already.\nseeker:That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know.\nseeker:I agree with you. It's one of my fears.\nsupporter:How do your children feel about this? And his?\nseeker:MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six.\nseeker:This isn't a new relationship.

Since we are in COVID, I don't see or talk to anyone that I used it.  So I feel pretty lonely, just going in circles in my head.\nsupporter:Do you feel as though Covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?\nseeker:Definitely.

Roll on 2021!\nseeker:I think it's hard for everyone.  I can't wait for it to be over.  I think we have another year till it's really over.  I'm I'm so tired already.\nsupporter:Me too!

Am good just concerned about my son.\nsupporter:Oh I see.  What's happening with your son?\nseeker:I suspect my son is in bad company. His most recent behaviour is so different from what I am used to\nsupporter:Oh that's hard to deal with.   My daughter ran with a bad crowd for a while and I remember the deep worry.\nsupporter:What sort of behaviour are you noticing?  How old is he?\nseeker:My son is 15. Recently he's keeping to himself and mostly stays locked in his room. He barely allows anyone in.\nsupporter:And when you try and talk to him about it what does he say?\nseeker:He says he's studying online. But I suspect he's doing other stuff online apart from study\nsupporter:Oh I see.  Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school?  Is he still seeing his friends at all?\nsupporter:It can be scary not knowing what our kids are up to online.\nseeker:Not really. He just has this one particular friend who comes over sometimes and they lock themselves in the room.\nsupporter:Hmm.  So a lot of mystery.   I can understand you being worried.   Is he your only child?\nseeker:I am so scared I don't want to confront him I have always tried to show him how much I trust him as away to make him feel responsible enough\nseeker:Yes. He is my only child and I am single parent\nsupporter:Thats good parenting!   Perhaps if you frame it as being about you, e.g. \"I am getting really worried, can you please explain....it's affecting me (affecting my sleep/work/whatever\" .... maybe it will inspire him to be more forthcoming\nsupporter:Any signs of depression?   I have been depresed before, and self-isolating can be a symptom, I've been there...\nseeker:Never thought of it that way. That could be a possibility. But he always seems happy and we chat a lot onlythat he his behind closed doors in his room for a long time everyday.\nseeker:Am also concerned about the friend who comes over. I don't really know his family or home just that he's from the neighborhood and they go to the same school.\nsupporter:Hmm.  My other thought is tell him what you just told me, that you have been trying to show him that you trust him....but be honest and tell him you are afraid.   Hopefully, he won't want you feeling that way, and will open up a bit.\nsupporter:Yes I can see that being concerning when you know nothing about the friend.

I'm just looking for some help really, I've been feeling down for a while and it's affecting my sleep. I feel tired during the day but cant fall or stay asleep at night.\nsupporter:Hi Megan, sorry to hear you are feeling down.  And having trouble falling asleep is something I go through from time to time, I'll share some tips I have if you like.\nseeker:That would be great, I'd appreciate some tips. Nice to know other people are in the same boat.\nsupporter:Just curious how long have you been feeling down?   And did you sleep okay before that?\nseeker:I think it's probably been around 6 months, but nothing that I can think triggered it. I have always had some problems with sleeping but it's never been this bad.\nsupporter:Okay so it sounds like your trouble sleeping has gotten worse since you started feeling low, and it's affecting your energy during the day then?  Am I understanding you right?\nseeker:That's exactly it, yes.\nsupporter:Here are some things I do....no coffee after noon...\nseeker:Okay, I drink a lot of coffee so that's definitely something I'll try.\nsupporter:I exercise in the morning if I can, for me that's a walk, I always sleep better on days I walk....\nseeker:Okay sure, I work in a desk job so I reckon moving around and getting out could help.\nsupporter:I LOVE coffee....had to wean myself back to maximum 3 cups in the morning though\nsupporter:Is your room quite dark?\nsupporter:I got light blocking curtains....seems to help\nseeker:Yeah at the moment I'm on around 6 cups a day so I'll cut it to 5 for a while then go from there. My room is dark, I have black out blinds.\nsupporter:Okay sounds good  :)  I use this podcast that has this guy with such a relaxing voice, doing guided sleep meditations, it's called Tracks to Relax\nsupporter:there's a premium option but the free is just fine\nseeker:Thanks for the suggestion, sometimes I listen to ASMR on youtube so I'm always looking for new things to listen to whilst falling asleep. I'll go for the free version.\nsupporter:whats ASMR?\nseeker:It's relaxing whispering, usually speaking or noises using objects. I find it very relaxing.\nsupporter:hmm I\"ll have to check that out!\nseeker:I think it helps me (usually), although not enough over the last few months unfortunately.\nsupporter:Have you spoken to your doctor about your low mood?\nseeker:Your tips have been helpful though I will definitely try to reduce the coffees and walk more.

I was in need of money, urgently, for my business. I helped him when he was in a similar situation. Now I am in situation, previously he was when I helped. I expected my friend surely will help.

IT is just the nature of the quarantine has really upped the anxiety level.\nseeker:I don't feel the option of escaping, changing the scenery a little bit or adjusting emotionally\nsupporter:you are doing the right thing by staying in the house but have you just went out side and took a walk to make you feel a little better\nseeker:it has also changed the relationship that I have with my housemates/friends.

I am in quarantine away from my family.\nsupporter:sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?\nseeker:Yes, I tested positive for the Covid\n virus on Wednesday.\nsupporter:It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.\nseeker:I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.\nsupporter:I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.\nseeker:I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.\nsupporter:I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.\nseeker:Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.\nsupporter:I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow.\nseeker:That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.\nsupporter:Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.\nseeker:I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.\nsupporter:We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.\nseeker:I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!\nsupporter:Think other way. You defeat it and you won.\nseeker:I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.\nsupporter:You are a strong person. You are almost there to win.

I don't really feel like I can express my actual feelings in my current living arrangement.\nsupporter:I understand.  I have had to stay by myself for most of the year due to the pandemic.  That has been hard.\nseeker:I've heard the pandemic has affected a lot of people. I'm always alone anyway...or with my roommate,so I haven't noticed much of a difference.\nseeker:It's difficult when we have absolutely nothing in common.\nsupporter:Have you tried different games that help you get to know each other?  Maybe try a movie or series.  I loved Sweet Magnolia's on Netflix.\nseeker:I'm mainly worried that she'll throw me out of the house and I'll have no where to live.\nseeker:Oh god forbid we watch a movie. She's too obsessed with CNN to watch anything else.\nseeker:She's become brainwashed by the tabloid media...\nsupporter:Oh my goodness.  The good thing is there is a moratorium on evictions so she would not be able to do that legally.  CNN can be overwhelming.  Try giving her some type of distraction.  Suggest yoga or some type of bonding.\nsupporter:I think 24/7 news is problematic but here to stay.\nseeker:I actually do yoga every evening. She hates it. I'm living in her home without a lease, so I wonder if she can just tell me to leave.\nseeker:I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch the news for more than to just catch up (If you like lies and nonsense)\nsupporter:As long as you have property there she would have to formally evict you.  That is the good news.\nseeker:That is good news. Thanks for letting me know that.\nsupporter:I think it is best to stick with a short local news report.\nsupporter:My pleasure.  So many people are worried about losing their place to stay but thankfully most are protected due to the pandemic.\nseeker:I just found mturk. I just started here. Any advice as to what to do? I've mainly just been doing surveys. I'm not good at the small tasks.\nsupporter:Check Youtube videos on using Panda's.  It will help you make more money.  I have done over 750,000 hits.\nseeker:Oh wow, that's amazing! I've done this particular hit 3 times...I've only found a person once though. I will definitely check out the videos. thank you!\nseeker:What are pandas? Or is it too hard to explain?\nsupporter:You are welcome.  Panda's help you keep grabbing hits.

But I'll wait one week and I'll talk to her\nsupporter:I would ultimately give an ultimate.  You will forgive her this one time.

What kind of questions do you have?\nseeker:What other ways can I get help to perform better? Who should I talk to?\nsupporter:Are you looking for help to perform better in a certain subject in college?\nseeker:Yeah I am, it's differential equations. Are you able to see the situation description I wrote that has more details?\nsupporter:I didn't see all the specifics but I remember taking that class.  I went to my counselor and got a tutor which helped so much.  It was offered for free at the college.  Do you think you that is something you'd like to check out?\nseeker:Yeah that could be useful. I'm not sure if my school offers that - the math department isn't very good. I'm an engineering major. I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead\nsupporter:I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.\nseeker:Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense?\nsupporter:Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.\nseeker:Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience\nsupporter:Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference.\nseeker:Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it\nsupporter:Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.\nseeker:That is actually one thing I'm pretty good at. I'm miserable when I'm tired, so I almost always get 7-8 hours a night.\nsupporter:It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials.  You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!\nseeker:Thanks! It's reassuring to know other people felt the same way with this course.

I spent 6 months on something that now I have to let go and start helping another engineering team at work.\nsupporter:You seem very concerned about this. It seems quite unfair! How do you feel about helping the other engineer?\nseeker:I don't mind the work. The manager we have is very biased against us older engineers.  He thinks we want to constantly help out the younger guys he hired.  THey are mostly unqualified and their work is sub par.\nseeker:I'm 41 and the new guys are all about 24.\nsupporter:I understand how stressful this must feel to you. Sounds like you are a great experienced worker, but they want to use your expertise instead to train the inexperienced worker.\nseeker:yes. I have been reluctant to complain to upper management. I have a couple of co-workers who have my level of experience.  They have complained and supposedly one of them will be our manager soon.  I have thought about looking for a new job. Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.\nsupporter:I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint. Maybe go to upper management and make it more like a concern than a complaint? If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (I can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.\nseeker:Thing is in my industry, aerospace interiors, the competition is cut throat in engineering. I already have to work about 55 hours/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol).  I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid.  So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nsupporter:You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems.\nsupporter:Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nseeker:Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols.\nseeker:I actually got this job through zip recruiter.   Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.\nsupporter:Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.\nseeker:I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated.  take on some freelance to supplement my income.  Upper management at my company is a bit...shall we say...uninterested in boat rockers.\nsupporter:I understand that. Freelance does equal freedom. Research opportunities. You sound like a smart man.\nseeker:Boeing is a place I'd love to finish our my career with but I went through a 2 year hiring process with them a few years ago. Once I was offered the position I had to decline because the move to Washington was not feasible at the time because of family issues.  oh well.\nsupporter:How does moving to WA. seem at this time? Boeing is an amazing company.\nseeker:I'd do it. I think they have a hiring freeze on at the moment.  Gulfstram in Georgia is close to me. They have been hiring contractors like gang busters. Problem is that is a terrible company. chew you up and spit you out.  What industry were you a manger in?\nsupporter:Advertising. Sounds like you have options. Hang tight for the next few months and see where the world is headed.

I tend to remove many things like MBA wherever its not required.\nseeker:I generally try to apply with a balanced resume, its just that market is highly competitive.\nsupporter:That might work, but I wonder whether HR will want your credentials once you get a job.\nseeker:I doubt HR will have any concerns about my credentials about being over-qualified after getting hired. The reporting manager may be anxious rather happy to know about my skillset\nsupporter:Ok. It's hard to know how companies play those things now. Sometimes they check your social media accounts for any inconsistency.\nseeker:Yes, they do check the social media accounts but I tried to keep generic profile over there to avoid concerns.\nsupporter:That's good thinking.

I have been quarantined for 5 weeks with COVID-19 (tested positive), so I am getting cabin fever.\nsupporter:Ready for the holidays\nsupporter:So you tested positive, must be hard\nseeker:I am starting to get an aversion to holidays.  When I was in college, my father was dying, and Thanksgiving was the last meal he ate at the family table...\nChristmas was the last time he ate solid food,\nand he died on the day after Epiphany\nseeker:So I have come to associate Thanksgiving through January as a time of loss.\nsupporter:The holidays can bring back memories, but you have other family around right\nseeker:This month has driven it home more, because I have had six people die this month.  It's starting to bring on flashbacks.\nseeker:No, my family all moved from the area.  The nearest is now half a country away and hasn't spoken to me in over ten years.\nsupporter:The virus is hard. along with the season\nseeker:It's been... interesting.\nsupporter:You must have friends around, right. have you contacted any\nsupporter:How long ago did your dad pass away\nseeker:Ahhh... I hate to be that guy, but I really don't have that many friends.  I have a couple people at my church who have checked in, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them friends (we don't hang out, I don't get invited over...)\nseeker:I was in college.  He died slowly and painfully.  It was really unpleasant.\nseeker:And he was a brilliant man.  I could only wish to be half of what he was.\nsupporter:That can cause loneliness as well. What about seeing if your family will chat and let them know you ae ok\nseeker:I don't even have contact information for them anymore.  The last known phone numbers have been disconnected and the last time I sent mail, it was returned for wrong address, no forwarding information known.\nseeker:I think they forgot about me.\nsupporter:Comparing yourself to others can be a positive and give you reason to strive more\nseeker:The only one I still have contact with is my mother.\nsupporter:Have you checked to see if she is ok\nseeker:I avoid comparing myself to others.  I usually come out on the bad side of it.\nseeker:I talk to her regularly.  She is okay, but I fear she is reaching the age where I know I won't have her much longer.\nsupporter:But use your dad as inspiration\nseeker:I'm just thankful I have had her this long\nseeker:That I do.  While I will never have the skills my father had technically, I am thankful that I did get his ability to be analytical and his compassion for others.\nsupporter:See that is a positive thing. You both need each other\nsupporter:That is great to hear. He is a role model  for you\nseeker:Absolutely.  I still remember him teaching me things that I use to this day.  I still smile when I think of one time when he first became ill and couldn't get out of bed...\nseeker:there was a project he wanted to do and it bothered him that it had not gotten done.  Well, I was able to do it, because he had taught me enough to know what to do.\nsupporter:That is a positive in itself. Keep his legacy going through you\nseeker:The look of pride in his face was priceless.\nsupporter:And you have that memory to live by\nseeker:The one thing I carry on because of him is my love for my church.  He was on the church vestry (governing board).  I am on my church worship team.\nsupporter:His smile is in your heart and you can still feel him\nseeker:I actually made church history, because I sing with the praise team (some churches call that a choir), but I sing many of the songs in American Sign Language.\nseeker:I am the first signing member of the church.\nsupporter:See that there in itself is a reason to smile\nseeker:2021 will be the 50 year anniversary of our congregation.\nseeker:I joined just over ten years ago.\nseeker:My church is my anchor.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Is there an issue I can provide you some support with?\nseeker:Yeah I am pretty anxious all the time. I feel that I made a mistake coming back to school to get a PhD.\nsupporter:So, to reiterate, you are suffering from anxiety due to school? Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?\nseeker:School is the start of the problem. I know that if I quit I can still be successful elsewhere but I also feel if I quit I will let my wife and kids down who were willing to leave family and friends to follow me to the school I wanted to go to.\nsupporter:I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment. I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing.\nseeker:I know I want this though. I enjoy what I do and what I would do for my career if I graduate. I mainly feel inadequate. I feel that I am not good enough. I am willing to do whatever it takes but fear that whatever my \"best\" is may not be good enough.\nsupporter:I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?\nseeker:It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral\nsupporter:This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.\nseeker:That is a really good point and helpful. Thank you!\nsupporter:Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next.\nseeker:That is exactly right. I need to focus more on what progress has been made and not on what progress hasn't been made yet because there is still time to make that progress.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I have been quarantined for 5 weeks with COVID-19 (tested positive), so I am getting cabin fever.\nsupporter:Ready for the holidays\nsupporter:So you tested positive, must be hard\nseeker:I am starting to get an aversion to holidays.  When I was in college, my father was dying, and Thanksgiving was the last meal he ate at the family table...\nChristmas was the last time he ate solid food,\nand he died on the day after Epiphany\nseeker:So I have come to associate Thanksgiving through January as a time of loss.\nsupporter:The holidays can bring back memories, but you have other family around right\nseeker:This month has driven it home more, because I have had six people die this month.  It's starting to bring on flashbacks.\nseeker:No, my family all moved from the area.  The nearest is now half a country away and hasn't spoken to me in over ten years.\nsupporter:The virus is hard. along with the season\nseeker:It's been... interesting.\nsupporter:You must have friends around, right. have you contacted any\nsupporter:How long ago did your dad pass away\nseeker:Ahhh... I hate to be that guy, but I really don't have that many friends.  I have a couple people at my church who have checked in, but I wouldn't go so far as to call them friends (we don't hang out, I don't get invited over...)\nseeker:I was in college.  He died slowly and painfully.  It was really unpleasant.\nseeker:And he was a brilliant man.  I could only wish to be half of what he was.\nsupporter:That can cause loneliness as well. What about seeing if your family will chat and let them know you ae ok\nseeker:I don't even have contact information for them anymore.  The last known phone numbers have been disconnected and the last time I sent mail, it was returned for wrong address, no forwarding information known.\nseeker:I think they forgot about me.\nsupporter:Comparing yourself to others can be a positive and give you reason to strive more\nseeker:The only one I still have contact with is my mother.\nsupporter:Have you checked to see if she is ok\nseeker:I avoid comparing myself to others.  I usually come out on the bad side of it.\nseeker:I talk to her regularly.  She is okay, but I fear she is reaching the age where I know I won't have her much longer.\nsupporter:But use your dad as inspiration\nseeker:I'm just thankful I have had her this long\nseeker:That I do.  While I will never have the skills my father had technically, I am thankful that I did get his ability to be analytical and his compassion for others.\nsupporter:See that is a positive thing. You both need each other\nsupporter:That is great to hear. He is a role model  for you\nseeker:Absolutely.  I still remember him teaching me things that I use to this day.  I still smile when I think of one time when he first became ill and couldn't get out of bed...\nseeker:there was a project he wanted to do and it bothered him that it had not gotten done.  Well, I was able to do it, because he had taught me enough to know what to do.\nsupporter:That is a positive in itself. Keep his legacy going through you\nseeker:The look of pride in his face was priceless.\nsupporter:And you have that memory to live by\nseeker:The one thing I carry on because of him is my love for my church.  He was on the church vestry (governing board).  I am on my church worship team.\nsupporter:His smile is in your heart and you can still feel him\nseeker:I actually made church history, because I sing with the praise team (some churches call that a choir), but I sing many of the songs in American Sign Language.\nseeker:I am the first signing member of the church.\nsupporter:See that there in itself is a reason to smile\nseeker:2021 will be the 50 year anniversary of our congregation.\nseeker:I joined just over ten years ago.\nseeker:My church is my anchor.\nsupporter:You are a positive for your church. Not many can sign language\nseeker:My pastor is wonderful.  He is like the little brother I didn't have but always wanted.\nsupporter:That is awesome. See you have a purpose\nsupporter:I imagine he is missing his big sister\nseeker:My favorite story about signing in the church is how it began...  I had asked to do it and had been shot down cold six times.  Well, I laugh now, but at the time I was angry.\nseeker:If you mean me, I'm male.\nseeker:But the last time I was told I could not sign for the church, I told the elder who said no that God was going to give him a sign.\nsupporter:But your determination kept your dream alive.sorry big brother\nsupporter:You are a very determined person. Don't let the fire die inside your heart\nseeker:Well, God delivered on the promise quickly.  That same who  morning we had a family visit who were on a road trip.  They just were passing through but wanted to go to church while travelling.\nsupporter:The Lord is using you to each others/\nseeker:They had a little girl about 6 or 7 years old who was Deaf.  She saw me sitting in the back of the sanctuary signing the lyrics to the songs, and praying in Sign.  Her face lit up and she started signing too.\nseeker:At the end of the service, she found me and gave me a big hug around my legs and then looked up and said \"I always wanted to go to a church where someone knew MY language!\"\nsupporter:God placed you there for that little girl\nseeker:From that point on, there was no problem with me signing in church.\nseeker:I think He placed her there for me, also.  It was a mutual deal.\nseeker:There is no one in my congregation at the moment who signs, but I keep hoping for the future.\nsupporter:You have a calling on your life. Don't let the dream die\nseeker:No.  That mission has been placed on my heart.\nsupporter:He will use you in mighty ways\nseeker:Well... I should be going, but thank you for taking the time to chat.\nsupporter:Ok. Hope I was of help\nsupporter:I am a Christian also\nseeker:You definitely were.  I am feeling better than I have in about a mo\nnth.  I appreciate that.\nseeker:God put you here tonight for a reason\nsupporter:God loves you.\nseeker:Of this I have no doubt.\nsupporter:Glad  iI was here.\nseeker:I am actually in the process of studying catechism with my pastor, and plan to be re-confirmed.\nsupporter:Live the dream and seek Him always\nseeker:I was confirmed in a different denomination as a child, but I learned nothing.  One day I realized that I have no knowledge of the faith, and that did not sit well with me.\nsupporter:Be Blessed for He lives inside of you\nseeker:So I am changing that and not just paying lip service to Jesus, but actively seeking Him.\nsupporter:Are you saved\nseeker:Absolutely.\nsupporter:Seek Him everyday\nsupporter:He is my 1st in the morning\nseeker:I was not always.  I drifted a few years back.  My church family gave me a gift and sent me to a religious retreat at a resort owned by my church denomination.  It was there and in that moment that I came back to God.\nsupporter:God has away to bring His sheep back. He knew you and did not give up on you\nsupporter:I fell away for 15 years, but He opened my eyes.\nseeker:I try to go each year, as it's an annual retreat.  I missed this year because of COVID, but hoping for next year.  I was going to take a friend from out of state.  He couldn't attend due to the pandemic.  But if all goes well, next year will be different.\nseeker:It was about 15 years for me, as well.\nseeker:I was never far away, just not close enough, if you know what I mean.\nsupporter:Your a gift from God to the world\nseeker:I left my childhood church because it turned into a false church, and it no longer teaches God's word.\nseeker:I still pray for them daily that they can realize what they are doing, repent and turn it around.\nsupporter:We were always close but He knew the time to bring you home\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Everything feels like hard work.\nsupporter:To be honest, I feel the same way sometimes, too.  It is nice to have someone to talk to about this.  Have you talked to anyone else about this yet?\nseeker:I haven't really, I feel like other people have their own issues and I don't want to burden them. It's good that others feel the same. Do you have any advice on what makes you feel better?\nsupporter:Yes.  I agree.  For me personally, I noticed if I think back of a time before I lost my motivation, sometimes it helps me to reenergize a bit.\nsupporter:What have motivated you in the past?\nseeker:Hmm, I'm finding it hard to remember a time I didn't feel like this! I feel like this has been going on forever! I used to enjoy walking, and generally getting things done around the house. I am also self employed and loved putting time into my business but I've been finding that hard recently.\nseeker:I've been watching a lot of Netflix and youtube and not doing much else.\nsupporter:I have been spending a lot of time home by myself as well.\nseeker:How do you cope with it? How do you not get bored and restless?\nsupporter:I noticed if I try to adhere to a schedule, even a very simple one, such as getting up at a certain time, making breakfast, and showering.  My days tend to go better.\nseeker:I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.\nseeker:That's a good idea, I could try that. At the moment I get up at around 11am but U have been trying to get up earlier but I just can't make myself do it. I've also been sleeping during the day which is maybe not good.\nsupporter:Have you tried reading?  I find reading motivates me sometimes, too.  Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.\nseeker:I used to get a lot of pleasure from reading and would always have a book on the go. Now reading feels like a chore, as if I am making myself do it.\nsupporter:I sometimes force myself to exercise when I get sleepy when I shouldn't be tired during the day.\nseeker:That's a good idea I could definitely try that.\nseeker:I suppose that is a little weather dependant though.\nsupporter:Maybe try YouTubing?  There are a lot of interesting channels that talks about science, technology, personal health, ... etc.  That can be beneficial to you and worthwhile.\nseeker:I do watch a lot of youtube, but it's mainly true crime I am into. I always forget there is other content on there other than what is in my subscription box.\nsupporter:Certainly.  I have a pullup bar and some weights at home.  Even without those, sometimes I just do some bodyweight exercises, such as pushups, squats, ... etc.\nseeker:Home workouts would be good. Do you use an app, or just make up the moves yourself?\nsupporter:Yes, the YouTube algorithm is not always the most helpful sometimes.  You can try logging out to see if you see some other recommendations.\nseeker:I will do that after this chat, and see if I can find any home workout videos on there.\nsupporter:I used to be in the military, so I have a rough idea of what exercises I can perform and how much of it I can do each time.  Looking up more information on it is a great idea.\nsupporter:Overall, I noticed if I can stay clean, healthy, and strong, many of my other problems tend to go away or at least appear less severe.\nseeker:I'll do that then, and see if there are any useful apps I can use on my phone so I can do workouts on the go. I know it will be hard to get myself into the habit of doing it but maybe if I stick at it I'll see rewards.\nseeker:Yeah I suppose I need to try more to not give in to all the negative thoughts.\nsupporter:I recommend finding a friend or partner to keep you accountable.\nsupporter:I used to have a spreadsheet for my exercises such as running, because I hate running.\nsupporter:Having to fill out that spreadsheet motivated me quite a bit at the time.\nseeker:I'd love to find a partner! At the moment I can't really go out and dating and I'm finding online dating tedious. That's a good idea, I use excel for work so could set up a spreadsheet for exercise.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

My parents are gone too, grief can be a long process.  Grief is tough.  That will get easier with time.\nseeker:My meds I take have been increased and I hate to just take meds to try to help\nsupporter:The thing is though, depression is an illness.

I used to be in a bunch of online support groups for single parents but life kind of got in the way and I didn't have a lot of time to focus on myself. I always had to be there for my son.\nsupporter:That's understandable. Most parents feel like you do so you're not alone. When I feel closed off I write. I make up stories where I'm always the heroe. Don't laugh. I always overcome some issue. I also write letters just to get out what I'm feeling. It helps and you should try it.

I'm feeling depressed and overwhelmed.\nsupporter:Please tell me more about it, when did it start?\nseeker:It all started earlier this year. I live with my parents because I'm unable to care for myself , due to a disability. Well my dad has dementia, and my mom, who was the primary caregiver, was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospital so now its up to me to keep everything afloat.,\nseeker:I'm having a really hard time with it.\nseeker:Between work, school, keeping up the house, and caring for my dad, it's a lot to handle.\nsupporter:That's very exhausting doing that much, I really feel bad for you, you're a strong person to be able to handle so much by yourself\nseeker:Thanks.

My depression and anxiety are through the roof, and honestly, I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.\nsupporter:Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?\nseeker:I actually am not able to go outside. Its been a few weeks.\nsupporter:Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better\nseeker:i try to avoid going out at all. It's hard for me to get around. Even taking the bins out is a struggle. I can't even walk my dog. I just open the door and he goes out , does his business and comes back.\nsupporter:I understand it's hard for a person like you. However, as I said, from my own experience, staying indoor for a long period does more harm than good\nsupporter:You don't have to go far, even just out in your backyard to have some sunlight as the first step is good enough\nseeker:maybe i will try that. little by little\nseeker:I'm really scared of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick.\nsupporter:Just take one step at a time, I believe you can do it as long as you put your mind in\nsupporter:If you don't get close to anyone and wear a mask, you should be fine\nseeker:Yeah, that is what they are saying in the news.

What is the issue?\nseeker:She has been having a problem with a different friend for years. I have been listening to these problems for all of that time. And even though it's so frustrating, because it's the same problem over and over again, I keep listening because she's my friend. But lately I have been going through a lot, and I haven't had as much time to sit and listen to these same problems, and she gets so angry telling me I don't care about her. The problems I've been going through are very serious, and I just don't have time to sit on the phone listening to the same stuff I've been dealing with for years.\nsupporter:I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling.  I would feel that way too\nseeker:It's been really rough. I've tried so hard to be there for her, and I feel like she just doesn't even appreciate it.\nsupporter:I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate?\nseeker:Yes, that's exactly accurate. And she is 50 years old, and the issues have all been high school type problems that I've been listening to. Stuff about how she didn't post on social media about her birthday, and little petty things like that. Not something an adult should be concerned with. And I still sat and listened to her all that time.\nsupporter:I completely understand how unappreciated and stressed this would make you or any person. Especially when our plate is full and its the same old same old and nothing is changing. Its like thinking doing same thing over and over you will get a different result when 2+2 equals 4\nseeker:Yes, exactly.\nsupporter:You are an extremely good and loyal friend and I am so proud of you. Most people would have left her.\nseeker:Thank you. That's really important to me. She was starting to convince me that I wasn't a good friend because I wasn't there for her right now when I had problems of my own. Real problems - like my daughter's engagement breaking up.\nsupporter:However, it is time to take the hard road. YOu are going to have to say with LOVE because its not always what you say but how you say it.  Give me a minute to please type it\nseeker:Okay, thank you.\nsupporter:You are going to have to sit her down and say  I need to be honest with you.  I have always been there for you but you are not willing to take my advice or others advice and quite frankly I just can't do it anymore. IF you want to remain friends I need you to grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you or even me.  Right now I could really use a good friend. I am going thru A LOT OF Sh** and I don't need this in my life. So\nseeker:I think that's a good idea. I'll try that.\nsupporter:if you aren't able to do that than I am afraid until you can be a true friend and not just a user than I need to end this friendship . I don't want to but I need to for my mental health and for myself and even for you.  I say this because I love you and I do care but this has become toxic\nseeker:Yeah, I like that. I think it's a good idea to say those things to her.\nsupporter:she really needs to hear it and it sounds toxic to me . I know I wouldn't want a friend to accuse me of not being there and from the chat look like its all about her and she s acting like a spoiled brat\nseeker:I agree.

Yo must get very exhausted.\nsupporter:Are you wanting to run away alone or move away on your own? Do you feel trapped when you say you want a new life?\nseeker:I am. My husband just got laid off at his job, but he didn’t really help with bills anyway. I’m just so depressed and I feel like I’m going to go crazy and no one even cares\nsupporter:Wow, that is a lot of pressure that you have to endure. Do you feel like you have anyone in your life who cares and listens?\nseeker:I could never leave my kids. But sometimes I feel like it would be so much easier to just be dead\nsupporter:I am really thankful that you reached out today and I am happy that you are here with me today. You are making a lot of sense and I appreciate you opening up.\nseeker:My mom cares, but she is having a lot of health problems so I don’t feel like I should bother her with my problems\nsupporter:Have you been able to tell any friends how you are feeling and how alone you feel?\nseeker:No. I have stopped talking to my friends and just kept to myself. I don’t think they even understand how I feel\nsupporter:I can understand how you feel. I live in a new town and dont have any friends here and it can be very lonely and isolating. Do you have any hobbies or do you have any time for yourself?\nseeker:I just want to hide in a hole and not talk to anyone\nsupporter:I have felt that way before and I reached out for help like you are today. I was so depressed that I need to start therapy.\nseeker:I’ve been listening to a lot of audio books, it’s a nice escape\nseeker:I wish I could afford a therapist\nsupporter:Do you ever write in a journal or are you able to exercise alone? Both of those can begin a path to healing.\nseeker:I was trying to exercise 5 times a week but when I feel depressed I can’t seem to summon the energy to exercise\nsupporter:I can relate to that. Maybe you can start with journaling and writing out your feelings and thoughts. They may help clear your mind especially in the evenings.\nseeker:I will try writing.

We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.\nsupporter:I wish for your fast recovery.

It is very difficult for me, however, to wear a mask for longer than a few moments.  Due to the mandates in my area, I would be required to wear a mask.\nsupporter:Well, have you tried online platforms like MTurk?\nsupporter:It can be bit tough to get into in the beginning, but with a decent amount of work and determination it might be able to help with your monetary problems.\nseeker:That is what I am currently doing, and it is helping some.  I have increased the time I work on there, so that will help some.  I would love a second source as well, however...just so I could really save some.\nsupporter:I hear you on that. I am disabled and the extra income helps a lot for my family. Unfortunately until the pandemic ends a part time job might not be in your best interest for now. Ebay flipping takes some time to get into as well but could help.\nseeker:Yes, I have thought of that, actually.  I have quite a few items I would love to sell.  I have never done it, though, so need to research how to ship items, etc.\nsupporter:Its actually very easy now. You can print out the slips at home and they tell you how much it will be. I have done it a few times, the last time was only a couple months a go.\nseeker:Well, I will definitely have to check that out.  It would serve two purposes : decluttering and making money.  I think I got anxious last week when I had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed.  I found out I need all new tires and new brakes.  Not easy on a fixed income.  Plus I am widowed.\nsupporter:I am sorry for that. Yea having a nest egg is ideal, but i know how hard it can be. I think with the extra cash and space it may be a big help to those anxiety issues. Do you drive a lot as it is now?\nseeker:I actually don't. Only to the grocery store, or to visit my daughter who lives about 20  minutes away.\nsupporter:Well at least you are not putting to much wear on them now. Have you checked with local governments for assistance? Even with things like medication?\nseeker:I am not on any medication, which I am so thankful of.  I have not checked any programs for assistance.  I'm not sure if I would even qualify.  It wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.\nsupporter:Believe me never hurts to try. A penny you save on something else can be a penny that goes into your savings\nseeker:That is so true!  I have been selling some items through my neighborhood online Marketplace and made $100 just this week.  I have also started a change jar.  Amazing how a bit here and there can add up.\nsupporter:Wow thats pretty good. Yeah it is. It seems you are very proactive about this which is really good.\nseeker:Yes.  I am definitely one not to give up, which is a good thing!  I appreciate your help.  I feel more positive now.\nsupporter:I am very glad i could be of some help.

But his dry behaviour makes me very sad.\nseeker:sometimes this leads to a fight\nsupporter:That must be hard to hear when you are trying so hard to do what's right.\nsupporter:I also am struggling to convince my father to stay away from crowds because of COVID.\nseeker:Sometimes this behaviour of him leads to a fight. and i end up crying!\nseeker:Untop of it, i feel awful because i end up yelling at home too\nseeker:Is it normal to yell at parents?\nseeker:My dad simply won't listen\nseeker:Is it normal to have a fight with your parents?\nsupporter:I'm sorry you have to go through this.\nseeker:I feel guilty to fight with him\nsupporter:Perhaps you can take some time for yourself with a friend?\nseeker:Do you suggest anything else?\nseeker:Yes i could do that. But that won't resolve my issue\nseeker:What do you suggest?\nsupporter:As my father is getting older, he is often frustrated.\nsupporter:It's harder to move, you have more aches and pains and this virus is scary.\nseeker:How should i deal with him?\nseeker:True that\nsupporter:Perhaps you could suggest him taking some deep breaths to calm down.\nseeker:It's very hard to convince him of anything. He thinks he is always right.\nsupporter:I understand as my father is the same way.  I often have to just hear him out and take time away in another room.\nseeker:It's hard on me, because i have a child to look after too. And my dad keeps interfering in my parenting with my child.\nsupporter:Do you have any other family support who understands your position?\nseeker:It's hard honestly. My spouse and me are separated.\nseeker:And i have a child who stays with me.\nsupporter:Perhaps there is some support in your community?  I have a child with autism and my father doesn't understand the behaviors and is critical of my parenting too.  I often seek support from an autism group with parents in my position.  Perhaps there is a group of single parents you could gain support from?\nseeker:I have a six year old child. Yes, maybe i would look for some support groups somewhere.\nseeker:Autistic child must be huge challenge i am sure\nsupporter:It sounds like you are really trying hard to do the best you can.\nseeker:Sometimes i suggest to my dad that he should seek therapy.

I've recently lost my job and I'm just really worried about how my bills are going to get paid. I feel so tired, you know?\nsupporter:I totally understand.  Losing your job is a very rough thing to go through, I'm sorry that happened to you.  Feeling constantly at red alert is taxing both mentally and physically.\nsupporter:There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking.  Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts.\nsupporter:In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do.  The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.\nseeker:Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out\nseeker:Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff\nsupporter:That makes sense.  You sound emotionally exhausted.\nseeker:Definitely, I feel like I could sleep forever but with my kids to worry about I don't have that option\nsupporter:Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating.  Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful.  I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down.  Whether those things are \"I have hot coffee and electricity\" or \"I won $1000 for free\", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.\nseeker:Messages could work, I could stick them around and I guess they coudl help not just me but my little ones too because I'm sure my moods been affecting them as well\nsupporter:That sounds like a great idea!  It sounds like you care a lot about your kids, I bet it's easy for you to be grateful for them :-)\nsupporter:And I know that they are grateful for you, whether they are able to articulate that or not\nseeker:Absolutely the little terrors are the reason I get up in the morning. I can't let them down, you know\nseeker:Their dad's not arpund so its just us\nseeker:I'm all they've got\nsupporter:Well that is an enormous amount of responsibility that has been placed upon your shoulders, but your attitude seems extremely pleasant and positive.  It does not sound easy, but you should make sure you build in some time for yourself if you can.\nseeker:I'm going to try, the messages idea is a really good one so I think I'll give that a try. I mean I am grateful for my kids and I guess things could be worse I do still have some savings left and I can always try to get another job\nsupporter:You definitely have options, but your situation is still tough, and you deserve relief where you can get it.\nseeker:I'll keep that in mind but thank you for taking the time to let me get things off my chest\nseeker:It really helps\nsupporter:Of course, I am happy if I was able to help.  You have a good heart and love your kids, you stay strong, you can do this :-)\nseeker:Thank you and I'll be trying!

I am not sure how to tell my spouse about my childhood trauma. He wants to know. He wants to help me.

I have even tried writing it down.. and nothing seems to work.\nsupporter:Just listening to you talk I can tell this is something that is making you extremely anxious.\nseeker:very much so.. whenever it gets brought up i free and begin to ramble and i think it makes him overwhelmed ..\nsupporter:One thing I would suggest is after writing everything down that you rehearse it for a while in front of a mirror and picture that you are talking to your husband while you are doing this.\nseeker:He had a very different childhood then myself. Almost complete opposite then myself. And I have tried... i cant seem to get my self to even put my past down on paper...\nseeker:When I have tried to i end up sending my self into a panic.\nsupporter:Have you reached out to other people or a group of people who may have experienced the same type of trauma you have?\nseeker:No.. i do not know many people fro my area. As soon as i was able to leave where i grew up i packed up and left. We live in a extremely rural area where there is not many new faces.\nsupporter:I have also experienced childhood trauma in my past and it was extremely hard to get through.

Her daughter and I hung out every day more than anyone else in the family hung out. I watched her. She always wanted to be with me and play games and talk with me\nseeker:The day she left she drew me drawings saying 'I love you' and she told everyone she meant 'I love you' the most about me\nseeker:and I cried and had a lot of anxiety symptoms afterwards because I'm literally not allowed to talk to her and I just feel she's in a negative place\nsupporter:That is really rough and im sorry that your parents are taking sides and not looking at this from the whole situation.\nsupporter:So she is not there currently?\nseeker:No she is not\nseeker:My parents gave her like 5-7 thousand dollars  and my grandma is giving her money every month. But just friday I was getting her stuff ready to pick up and I found like 700 dollars of clothes with tags on them and tons of expensive makeup and creams barely used\nseeker:I just worry a lot about my niece she is so sweet, funny, and smart and she's living with someone who makes horrible decisions\nseeker:sorry I'm talking a lot but just kinda unloading\nsupporter:Well i can see you really care for your niece. It also seems like your sister is a toxic person who is using your family. It may be rough not being able to see your niece but it might be better for your own well being to have this space from her.\nsupporter:No keep going, sometimes just getting it out there helps\nseeker:Yeah, I think you are right, I am more productive and have more self esteem since she has moved out.\nseeker:But it's a tough loss.\nseeker:I do appreciate you listening\nsupporter:Yea usually never anything good about loss. I am glad you are doing better now though. Hopefully she can turn herself around\nsupporter:Oh not a problem at all!\nseeker:Yes. I don't have hope about that.

I too have felt this anxiety.\nsupporter:It is a very difficult situation, and can really bring out the worst in our mental health.\nseeker:I see. Sorry to hear that. I don't go out until it's absolutely necessary, only when I have errands or for work. And so for more than half a year, I have not gone out for any frivolous walks, to the movie theatre, for hikes, or to workout \ns I used to.\nseeker:yes and I feel that. I have pretty much been staying indoors all this time.\nseeker:I feel lonely and sleep at abnormal times, workout a lot less, eat a lot less healthy, etc.\nseeker:There's no coherent or healthy lifestyle pattern, as my life pretty much was put on hold from back in March.\nsupporter:Well, it sounds like you are doing pretty well given the circumstances. It is good that you have found activities to keep busy.\nsupporter:I understand the lack of structure. It can be difficult but also freeing.\nseeker:well I have, but a lot of the times I am just wasting time and procrastinating and kind of just staring off into space and not doing much at home.\nseeker:Yes thank you for pointing out the lack of structure, that was the word I was looking for.\nseeker:It was freeing at first, but then I realized that it was going to repeat perpetually and that I was going to miss the entire summer, etc.\nsupporter:It can be a good time to try a project or new direction you haven't had time for until now. Or just try to think of what your possibilities are.\nseeker:and I felt somewhat claustrophobic etc. And also scared to go out and be in public because I get paranoid at who's infected, etc.\nseeker:yeah that's a good idea.\nsupporter:I have a good feeling that we will have some normalcy by summer 2021\nseeker:I wanted to take up writing more, but my online education got in the way and my goal became unrealized.\nseeker:yes hopefully you're right\nseeker:and how about you? How have you been coping so far?\nsupporter:I understand. As long as you are being cautious and following the guidelines, you are doing all you can to protect yourself. That is a good thing.\nseeker:yes I am trying to be as careful and not think to much as I can.\nsupporter:Just taking it one day at a time and focusing on the positives.\nsupporter:Obviously some days will be easier than others\nseeker:I see. I was okay for the last few months to be honest, and getting used to the routines. But it was just that for the last two to three weeks, my city started having a rise in the cases from a second wave.\nseeker:And that's when my anxiety came back and my guard is up again\nsupporter:Hopefully you can see the light at the end of this tunnel. The second waves seem to be a trend, and we made it through the first one.\nseeker:yeah that's true and have been lucky so far as I don't know anyone personally that has been infected.\nsupporter:That is a good thing!\nseeker:And have also been lucky that certain things didn't happen, like a massive shortage in supplies and food. There was for the first month or so, but stuff like that were eventually smoothed out. So I agree with you that in due time, things will resolve themselves. I sure can go for that vaccine now, that's for sure.\nsupporter:I think you are doing the right thing.

Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious.\nsupporter:I understand that college can be financially demanding.\nseeker:It is a rip off for what you get.....\nseeker:Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021\nseeker:My anxiety is from the costs of college as well.\nsupporter:You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it.\nsupporter:Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you\n any good.\nseeker:Yeah, but big debts are big debts\nsupporter:Do you feel better after talking about all of this?\nseeker:Yeah, but do you think I should take a different approach to things?\nseeker:Or find some other way to release my anxiety?\nseeker:I am still anxious about the end of school\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true.  However if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.\nseeker:yes. thank you for concern\nsupporter:When I was in college, I worked for the school and the library.  It was not a lot of money, but in addition to a small check, it made me more indispensable to the university.\nsupporter:I think you would be able to handle both, as long as you are clear from the beginning about what you need from the job.

I don't particularly like her and that she maybe picks up on that.

Maybe he/she could arrange a family meeting\nseeker:I get that. It's hard to look at them. I'm not sure what to do to cope. Lately, my coping skills haven't been all to healthy\nsupporter:I did that with my husband when we were fighting, having a counselor in the room helped us gain insight.\nseeker:I have a psychiatrist and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for a therapy currently.

I just met with two of the board today to go over where the organization is.\nsupporter:you should not have anything to worry about as long as you did not play the game then you will be fine and you will not get in trouble or your boss will not see that as a problem.\nseeker:Thanks. I tried to just support her privately and seem neutral publicly. I did like her too. I thought she was good.\nsupporter:I would just suggest you to have no contact with her right now until all this passes\nseeker:I text her to see how she was doing but haven't text with her since Friday. Any other ideas?\nsupporter:I would also have a talk with your boss about the situation and let him know how you are feeling\nseeker:I also want her job. Does that seem weird to talk with him about that too?\nsupporter:Did you see your director playing the game?\nsupporter:I would not bring up about you wanting her job just yet give it a couple of days\nseeker:No, her boss did not play the game. He actually pulled out and let others handle it so he didn't seem biased. She overplayed her hand.\nsupporter:I can see this is a tough being in a situation like this\nseeker:Yeah. I have never been this high in an organization so I just don't know what to do. I am hoping someone outside the organization might have a better view of what I should do.\nsupporter:As long as you did nothing wrong then i am sure you will be just fine\nseeker:Thanks.

How are you feeling today?\nseeker:Hello\nseeker:I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible?\nsupporter:Of course! What sort of issue is it?\nseeker:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best.\nsupporter:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?\nseeker:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death!\nsupporter:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?\nseeker:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament?\nsupporter:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!\nseeker:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one.\nsupporter:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that.\nseeker:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser.\nsupporter:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing.\nseeker:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal?\nsupporter:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?\nseeker:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years.\nsupporter:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?\nseeker:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-)\nsupporter:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!\nseeker:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion.

I wish I could get over it. I can't get her off my mind. She's dating this total loser.\nsupporter:That's tough... so you're saying that you grew apart a little? Or do you think it was more one-sided?\nseeker:It probably was more me than her. \nMaybe I should have done more to show her that I cared for her. Am I not romantic enough? Some guys just aren't that way.\nsupporter:I completely understand, and I don't think you should beat yourself up over it!\nseeker:That's a fair point. I shouldn't be too hard on myself.  I didn't really grow up in a romantic family. I don't know how to do that stuff, but maybe I could learn.\nsupporter:Exactly, and remember everyone is different, perhaps you just weren't her right one, and that can go both ways.\nsupporter:Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?\nseeker:That's true. I really got hung up on her. I thought she was perfect and that we were perfect together. She didn't see it that way. I can't really change who I am, and she couldn't change who she is.\nseeker:I don't know if I can change myself for her. Maybe there is something basic that she wants that I just don't have? I should probably change for future relationships.\nsupporter:That's a great line of thought, its good that you're able to identify that yourself\nseeker:What do you think I could do to improve myself?\nsupporter:I suggest that you stay exactly the way that you are. I feel like you'd be happier that way and also more likely to find someone who shares the same values as you\nsupporter:If you change who you are, it sort of means that your ex still has a hold on you, you know?\nseeker:Will the same problems show up in the next relationship though? It could be a long search before I find someone that matches with me?\nseeker:That's true. But I feel like I should take away something from this experience.\nsupporter:I guess that depends on you, would you rather compromise for a relationship or find one who'll really last and not have to change?\nseeker:I think all relationships require compromise and change.

Friends can be big help\nseeker:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work.

I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking.\nsupporter:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier\nsupporter:spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.\nseeker:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking.\nseeker:Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym.\nsupporter:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people\nseeker:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot.\nseeker:exactly.

This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.\nsupporter:OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol\nsupporter:Is this your first holiday alone?\nseeker:Yes, exactly!  And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash.  A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary!

Does that sound possible?\nseeker:i am an army veteran\nseeker:i defended the county and risked my life. i want to defend my children and my home how that i am back in country\nsupporter:Thank you for your service. I can understand how that might be a difficult situation for you, especially with your experiences. How are you handling this situation?\nseeker:thank you. i'm just really worried. my neighbor is a single woman. last month her boyfriend beat her up and she called the police. it took 35 minutes to respond\nseeker:i have an 8 year old daughter and five year old twin boys. i want to protect my children from harm\nsupporter:You are welcome. That is really kind of you to want to protect your children from harm. It seems like you feel the best way to do this is through owning guns? Have you thought of any alternatives, since the votes have been cast?\nseeker:what alternative? the police are so backed up everywhere they can't respond fast enough. they should be our first line of defense here in the us against bad guys but that doesnt happen or they ccant always be trusted to respond quickly and efficiently so i feel we have to take it upon ourselves. if someone were to break in and has a gun.... i mean.. criminals dont get guns the legal way anyway you know. what should i do...throw a knife at them? lol\nsupporter:That is a good point you bring up about the quickness and efficiency of protection that guns can provide.\nsupporter:How you thought of any other alternatives that could help your family, regarding the process of obtaining guns during a Biden presidency?\nseeker:not a clue. do you have any suggestions?\nsupporter:Definitely! My first step would be understanding the gun policy that Biden would have and confirming the new process. Does that sound like something that could be a good starting point?\nseeker:true..i may be worrying over nothing\nsupporter:I think you are just being careful and protective of your family. That is very honorable of a veteran like yourself.\nseeker:thank you\nseeker:i guess going to war makes you worry about things a lot of people dont normally have to huh\nsupporter:Yes, that sounds like the case. Are there any practices that have helped you when you're worried?\nseeker:well...the va has me do jornaling, deep breathing and mediation. kinda embarasing to admit...\nsupporter:Don't be embarrassed! To be honest, I have had experiences with some of those, including deep breathing. I also find it helpful.\nseeker:thanks for sharing. that makes me feel better. :)\nsupporter:Of course!

I was in a similar situation not too long ago and I understand how hard this must be for you.\nseeker:I taught that she was my everything hereafter.\nseeker:but the fate plays a great game upon me\nsupporter:During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain. Is there something you can do to take your mind off of it until you're ready to manage your feelings?\nseeker:I have some activities to do so, but i cannot able to concentrate on what i am doing\nsupporter:Okay, that's very understandable. I'm sure there's another strategy we can come up with.\nsupporter:Do you have a friend or family member you can talk about your feelings with?\nseeker:yeah! i have few friends\nsupporter:That's great. You've already taken a huge step by reaching out for help and that's a big deal! A good next step might be letting the people around you know that you need some support at this time. Sometimes people don't know something until you tell them, even if it seems obvious. Is that something you can do?\nseeker:But i can't tell this to them because they also become sad when they know about this\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I have been feeling quite lonely too, I find myself feeling lonely at work and struggling to find someone I trust to talk to about these emotions. Do you have a friend or family member that you trust who might understand some of these feelings?\nseeker:i do have a few friends that i think i can talk to about how i am feeling however the thought of them being too busy with their work is what prevents me from reaching out to them.\nsupporter:I understand. Correct me if i'm wrong, it sounds like you're nervous to open up to these trusted people because you think they might be distracted by their work to provide the empathy you need and fully understand how you are feeling. Does that sound right?\nseeker:you know i think that you are right about this. it has always been difficult for me to open to others even with those that have been there for me when i needed someone. i feel like a mix of emotions nervous but at the same time wanting to reaching out for help\nsupporter:I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?\nseeker:i have been writing for a while but due to my emotions i have stopped writing like i used to. when i did write i did notice a change in my feelings it became more positive and less depressed. now that i stopped writing its like i went back into depression\nsupporter:It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?\nseeker:yes writing has been a huge help for me. i would take your suggestion and begin writing again to feel better. and i have let others read what i wrote and they have said it has helped them get over their depression and helped them understand me more\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I just don't know how to deal and cope from this.

Any ideas?\nsupporter:Would you consider taking some sort of job on a temporary basis, even though it is way out of your normal field?  Bar tending or something?

It's not a panacea but it can help in the short term.\nseeker:No medications, a bit stronger than that. I can cope without that.

One of those children is a child from his previous marriage. We constantly argue about how he favors that child over our other 3.\nsupporter:Oh no, that's not good. Do the other kids see it as well?\nseeker:2 of the children are younger so they do not realize it but the other child is older and definitely notices.\nsupporter:Does your husband realize that the other child notices it and how it hurts them?\nseeker:I have told him but he is in denial of the whole situation.\nsupporter:Why do you think he favors that child? Is that child only with you part-time that he feels he needs to make the most of that time?\nseeker:The child is with us every other week and maybe that is why he treats him differently but my husband knows that it is causing problems in our relationship and refuses to change those behaviors. I just do not know what to do anymore.\nsupporter:Is there someone that's close to both of you that you could talk to, that way they can help him see that it's very apparent that he's treating him different?\nseeker:I suppose I could talk to his mother. But, I have reservations because I feel like she will side with him since it his her son.\nsupporter:Very true, and it would likely be better with someone no quite so close to the situation. But you also don't have to attack him to her, just lay out the facts. I understand the frustration, it's hard to see your kids hurting or feeling like they're not enough. Is this the biggest issue you guys are dealing with in your marriage?\nsupporter:Or is it just another thing you're not getting along on?\nseeker:That is very true. This is our main issue. I suppose I need to find someone who is close to us both but not necessarily a family member.\nsupporter:Someone who has seen you interacting as a family and maybe has noticed it as well.\nseeker:Yes, that is a good idea.

Can't complain very much about it.\nsupporter:That's awesome, is there any aspect about your job that you don't like or enjoy as much?\nseeker:To be honest, not really.  I pretty much self-manage and do not have to deal with people, which is a good thing for me.  Every now and then I'll have to work with a new person who isn't as competent and that can be frustrating.\nsupporter:I can understand it, it sounds like you are in a position where you oversee others are in a teaching capacity. I too am in a similar position, and when people aren't as responsive to my ideas, it can definitely irritate me.\nseeker:Yeah.  It's more of a competency problem with me I think.  I'm fine if people aren't responsive to my personal ideas, but as far as a work situation - or any situation where there are pre-agreed situations that must be dealt in certain ways - that is frustrating.  I think I expect too much  from people - but really my expectations aren't that high, I don't think - if I really think about it.\nsupporter:That makes sense, but it might be helpful to think about the other person's situation. Perhaps he/she hasn't had the same amount of training? Perhaps, they just need a little more guidance than other people who are more able to complete the tasks.\nseeker:That is true, and a good point.  My main issue - it's not just related to work - I'm not a \"liker\" of people in general, but I am nice to everyone. I have a hard time relating to most people.\nsupporter:What aspects do you especially have a hard time relating with?\nseeker:Well, it seems someone has to have to have gone through some hard times as well, for me to relate to them.  And to have learned from those hard times.  So that cuts out a good bit of people who have had good lives - and then half the people who have gone through some stuff haven't learned from it and made themselves better.

Often Im fine with the way thjngs are going, but every once in a while it bothers me.\nsupporter:I think it's great that it doesn't happen often and that you are able to recognize the few situations where it does begin to bother you.\nseeker:Yeah I try to stay cognizant of these things.

I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and \nrestrictions\nsupporter:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.

Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary!\nseeker:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation\nsupporter:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?\nseeker:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with?\nsupporter:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.\nseeker:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself?\nsupporter:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact.\nsupporter:Maybe organizing a \"zoom party\" would start to lift your spirits.\nseeker:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this?\nsupporter:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.\nseeker:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also?\nsupporter:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.

After all we have been through together, we were even talking about getting our own place together and now all that will be for nothing!\nsupporter:I think you are reflecting on your plans together and the thought of the relationship ending is making you upset and angry.\nseeker:Yes that's right. I know getting angry doesn't help but I want things to go back to the way they were.\nsupporter:Ok so based on what you have told me I think that your girlfriend has got a new job and you are planning on moving in together is that correct?\nseeker:Yes that's right but that's what couples do isn't it?\nsupporter:It is but that is a lot of change all happening at once. Perhaps she is getting a little bit scared and rather than dealing with the situation she is running away, perhaps you should talk about this and see how she responds?\nseeker:I still think there is someone else that has come between us.\nsupporter:Have you got any evidence of this like seen a text message or has she behaves strangely?\nseeker:No I haven't, it is just a feeling.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Too many people are of a furlough scheme, but the work load is still the same ! it is absolutely manic ! i am working 4 departments at once\nsupporter:It is really a lot of work. You might not have any spare time for yourself and family. Situation is really drastic. You should talk to your boss.\nseeker:My boss believes that I should just take the workload as it is. I dont know what to do.\nsupporter:I can understand your situation very well as it happened with me in past. In this scenario you should take small breaks to relax your body and mind. You will feel better.\nseeker:I hope so, I am very scared to lose my job, as my boss says I am not capable to do my work if i get stressed out so easily\nsupporter:Time is running bad for all of us. We have to take care of our health at this time. Stress can lead to so many disease and it will be hard to afford that extra burden in terms of time and money.\nseeker:Do you think I am better off finding something else or at least try ?\nsupporter:Yes, you should keep looking for it with your current job. There is no harm in being prepared.\nseeker:oh absolutely ! Do you think I should try out medication to help with stress?\nsupporter:You should consult a doctor for that. You can try yoga or meditation if you can take little time for yourself.\nseeker:I will give this a go! Are there any home remedies I can try ? I can barely get hold of my doctors, it is so hard to get an appointment!\nsupporter:You should try to give bit time to yourself. Try to talk to friends and family over the weekend. All these things always work for me.\nseeker:sadly we are not alowed to go out in this pandemic , it is so hard to keep social .\nsupporter:That's true ! Still you can go and relax in your backyard with family or talk to them on phone. We will feel good.\nseeker:Thank you for your advice, very halpful !

Kinda having a rough day today.\nsupporter:I am sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?\nseeker:Sure.  It's coming up on 3 years next month that I lost my boyfriend in a car accident.  Its just really rough this time of year.\nsupporter:Oh I am so sorry to hear that. I cannot imagine how hard that must have been for you.\nseeker:Extremely hard.  I remember that morning like it was yesterday.  He got killed within an hour after leaving the house on his way to work.\nsupporter:He was killed so soon after you last saw him?\nseeker:Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him.\nsupporter:Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!\nseeker:I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed.\nsupporter:Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?\nseeker:I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not.\nsupporter:I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor\nseeker:I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot.\nsupporter:Are you still in touch with his family and friends?\nseeker:I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Tell me what's going on.\nseeker:yeah I guess different factors, just self isolation for months due to the pandemic, and nearing the end of my studies and experiencing that final last-minute crunch with studying and assignments.\nseeker:I am more stressed and anxious than anything, and not really depression.\nsupporter:Understood.   You have a lot on your plate, especially with the \"new normal\".\nseeker:yes that's right. The plate issue is more to do with my studies now than the pandemic.\nseeker:Though the pandemic is adding to my anxiety and fear of the outside world\nseeker:especially when I have to go out everytime for errands and personal admin.\nsupporter:Are you doing online schooling?  And yes, going anywhere  can be a bit nerve-wracking\nseeker:yes I am. I preferred the old-school way. I've completed university before and it's much better to do things in-person. My online studies have been in place even before the pandemic.\nseeker:Just finishing up with courses and catching up with last minute stuff\nseeker:I feel like so little time when in fact I had loads of time for the last few months.\nseeker:I just seem to think and do things slower and more distracted\nsupporter:I understand; sometimes I have moments like that, too.\nseeker:like time is moving on so quickly and there's so little hours in the day but I feel that I don't do enough in a day with my school, kind of distracted or wasted time and then when I do something, I look at the time and am sometimes surprised at how much time had actually elapsed when it felt like I didn't do much.\nsupporter:What kind of things are you doing for yourself?  Do you have a place to or a thing to do to...decompress?\nseeker:I think this has to do with the pandemic at the start of the year and that changed my momentum and rhythm in life and coupled with social isolation, which puts a damper on my studying mentality, I think.\nseeker:I spend tons of time at home nowadays. I try to surf the net and read up on stuff, and that takes a lot of my time, and kind of aimless, and what I would say is procrastination. I work out from time to time, but not as much as I used to before the pandemic.\nsupporter:Sure, it sometimes feels like time is different right now.   Like your typical life patterns just did a complete circle.\nseeker:I wanted to set aside hobbies and things to develop, like writing during the pandemic, and improve on that skill, but I never got to do that. And now so many months have gone by, and all that's on my mind and plate now are my studies, because it's like I do things slower and leave it till the last minute, even though I know I can pass, but just not as good a mark as I would have liked and not my usual work and study ethics from before.\nseeker:yeah not only a complete circle but to me, it's like an aimless road to nowhere, and it goes on and on and repeats day after day\nseeker:that's how it felt for the last few months\nseeker:and everyday is the same and at home, and only two months ago I started working in a new part-time position and that got some normalcy back and less stress and alleviated unpredictability with the economy for me.\nsupporter:Understood!  I'm not in the exact same situation, but I feel you.  There's the thought there would be so much to do things and...there's not.   And you feel stuck a bit.\nseeker:stuck for sure. It still amazes me that it's november and not march, because it still feels like that.\nseeker:and nowhere as festive, fun, and alive as last november. It's a huge change\nsupporter:Definitely a massive change!\nseeker:it feels nothing special, and not normal, and not even like a real november, you know? It's like even if it's christmas, I wouldn't ackowledge it's christmas even though it is, because of the changes and we can't do the things w\ne used to do.\nseeker:hopefully, scientists can study all these phenomena and our physiological, social, and mental responses to the pandemic. There will be so much that can be learned from all this, I feel.\nsupporter:Of course.    We can'r celebrate the way we used to, we might not be able to visit family.   Oh yes, this is a learning opportunity about anxiety and isolation\nseeker:And it's worse because I live by myself so don't have someone here. But I do talk on the phone with my friend daily about things and that does help a lot.\nseeker:yeah like for me, I am not able to fly back to visit my folks this year, and this is the first time\nseeker:And I feel bad about it but nothing I can do\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I'm the one who hates it.\nsupporter:My goodness! How do they respond when you ask to end the conversation?\nseeker:I tell him, but he just doesn't get it.

As far as that advice, I have hung up, but he gets extremely offended easily.\nsupporter:That sounds really difficult if he gets offended so easily. I find it hard to talk to some of those kinds of friends.\nseeker:I'm at my wits end. I tell him all the time. \"You talk too much. You gotta stop talking at me. You gotta give the other person a turn. You gotta respect other's time.\"\nsupporter:What do you get out of the friendship with this other person?\nseeker:Well, I've been friends with him for a long time. He's funny and can have interesting perspectives on things. Also, we have done a lot together in the past.\nsupporter:That sounds like a lot that the two of you have been through. Were there other times that your friends was more equally responsive or attuned to you in conversations?\nseeker:Oh, yes, I have other friends in conversations who can take turns and understand the concept of time just fine.\nseeker:I just don't know what to do about this guy in particular. I still want to be his friend, but he just doesn't change.\nsupporter:I wonder if there is anything nice you could do for yourself when you are talking to him that would make it easier to talk to him.\nseeker:Do you think I should just have a timer that goes off at 1 minute and let it beep in his face if he goes on for too long to train him like a monkey?\nsupporter:I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.\nseeker:I just need a method. Talking to him is just not working.\nseeker:He is hard to condition.\nsupporter:Would it hurt his feelings to use a timer like that? It may for some other people.\nseeker:Yea, but I might be able to slip some humour in there to take the edge off because it is so silly.\nsupporter:Humor is really helpful for a lot of people.\nseeker:Any other ideas?\nsupporter:Sometimes, people draw or do something else distracting with their hands when talking to someone who dominates the conversation.\nseeker:So your option is to start just doing something else when he is talking? He might get the message in a subtle way?\nsupporter:Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded.\nsupporter:The strategy works well for me with some of my family members who seem like they will never change. But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more.\nseeker:This is true, and it isn't bade advice. Haha! That is funny. Yes, maybe I should find something to carry around with me that I can enjoy.\nseeker:I don't really like to draw...\nsupporter:Is there anything else that you like to do that would be distracting while also letting you somewhat participate in the conversation?\nseeker:Yes, perhaps I should just use the internet when he starts talking too much.\nseeker:I have a phone.\nsupporter:That sounds really helpful. Sometimes people also play phone games or with a fidget spinner. I like your idea of looking on the internet.\nseeker:This solves the problem in person, but it doesn't solve the talks over the phone, but it has been 15 minutes now and this has been helpful enough.

I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;'\n know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nsupporter:That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nseeker:It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nsupporter:I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!\nsupporter:How long have you guys been together?\nseeker:It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nsupporter:Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you?\nsupporter:Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nseeker:Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nsupporter:I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nseeker:It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she\nseeker:she's safe etc\nsupporter:I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!\nsupporter:Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nseeker:To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nsupporter:Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore.\nsupporter:And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nseeker:That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nsupporter:I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard\nseeker:Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her.

Do you enjoy the work?\nseeker:I'm always taking one call after the other and barely got time to think about my problems I'm dealing with\nseeker:I enjoy my job\nsupporter:The work distracts you from your problems but it does not give you time to address them.\nseeker:I feel like I get to help alot of people\nseeker:it distracts me from my problems exactly\nsupporter:I'm sure you do! Phone support requires a lot of patient explanation. That is challenging for many people.\nseeker:I'm actually one of the best at my job\nseeker:I wish I was that good with myself personally\nsupporter:I'm glad you have found success and fulfillment at your work.\nseeker:Thank you\nsupporter:If your job is good for you, what do you think makes you feel depressed then?\nseeker:I don't know what I'm going to myself when I'm not working\nseeker:I feel hopeless about many things\nsupporter:Exercise? Reading? School? Friends?\nsupporter:Hopelessness might be something that you have learned because you have expectations.\nsupporter:Do you feel that there has to be some sort of result? Progress? Improvement?\nseeker:trying to lose weight, trying to void getting diabetes, having better conversation with boyfriend , convince him to spend more time with me instead of work buddies after work hours, want to finish college, being able to buy a house, improving my credit, convincing my dad and brother to get mental help\nsupporter:If you didn't do any of those things ever, how would you feel about yourself?\nseeker:having a more active lifestyle , \nmaking new friends\nseeker:those are things I need to accomplish\nsupporter:Now imagine you achieve all of those things, and you do so in spectacular fashion. Would you be happy? Or would you find another reason to feel hopeless?\nseeker:I believe those are the things that have been bothering me for a long time\nseeker:not being able to accomplish those things makes me feel hopeless\nseeker:frustrated\nseeker:feel like I'm meaningless to thers\nsupporter:It's important to remember that you choose what goals to pursue. You decide the criteria for success and failure. You are the final arbiter of your life.\nseeker:those are all goals in my life that I need to reach\nseeker:I just don't know how most of the time\nsupporter:I understand. We all have goals. Goals can be helpful. But ask yourself why you chose those particular goals.\nseeker:I feel like I can't get guidance anywhere\nseeker:those are goals that when I accomplish them it will make me feel better\nsupporter:It sounds like you need someone to tell you what to do, or to give you permission to do what you want to do.\nseeker:if I accomplish them it will feel like there was improvement\nseeker:probably I've been used to my dad telling me what to do for a long time\nseeker:I lack self motivation\nsupporter:If you need permission, I hereby grant you permission to pursue what is meaningful to you.\nsupporter:You gave me a list of things that you want to achieve. Pick one.\nseeker:I want to do\n all those\nseeker:I'm not sure what should I do first\nsupporter:I understand. Which one is more important. Which is the one you can do right away? Also: which one do you really *not* want to do?\nseeker:I feel like all those goals will take some time\nseeker:can't be accomplish right away\nsupporter:Of course. Anything worthwhile takes time.\nseeker:I need to stay on top of those goals but I feel like I get side tracked\nsupporter:You feel compelled to pursue these goals. Why? If you don't, what is the worst that could happen? What if you only pursued one goal?\nseeker:pursuing only one of these will not be enough to make me happy I will keep thinking about the goals I need to accomplish\nsupporter:You need to readjust your expectations, which are causing you to feel unhappy.\nseeker:is there a technique that you can suggest I follow to feel self motivated and keep my goals organized and in check\nseeker:I will feel successful after completing most of these goals\nsupporter:Pick a small action, like making your bed. Establish a habit of doing it daily. It will be easy to build on that success, but you might first establish a habit.\nseeker:yeah sometimes I don't make the bed I wait to see if my boyfriends makes it sometimes\nseeker:sometimes I do make the bed\nseeker:it's not that bad doing that\nsupporter:Make the bed every day. Then pick another small goal.\nseeker:I actually feel good about my self after making the bed\nseeker:procrastination seems to get the best of me\nseeker:I wish I made the bed more often\nsupporter:That is evidence that you should continue that behavior.\nseeker:that sounds weird\nseeker:not what you said I referring to what I said I think it was weird\nseeker:right?\nseeker:maybe you're right I need to make it a habit\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

Anyone there?\nseeker:Hi sorry\nseeker:I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis\nsupporter:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?\nseeker:In about a month.\nsupporter:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.\nsupporter:Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?\nseeker:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.\nsupporter:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.\nsupporter:Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.\nseeker:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\nsupporter:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.\nsupporter:Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.\nseeker:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\nsupporter:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that\nsupporter:You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.\nsupporter:That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable.\nseeker:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.\nsupporter:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.\nsupporter:Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.\nseeker:My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable.\nsupporter:Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!\nseeker:I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake.\nsupporter:It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!\nseeker:That sounds like a wonderful feeling. But so far away.\nsupporter:My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards.\nseeker:That's a very poetic way of putting it.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors.\nseeker:To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal.\nseeker:And I realized that we were fighting so much because I wanted him to eat healthier and be healthier and he was not going to change and it wasn't even right for me to change him if he didn't want help.\nseeker:So, I am sure he felt attacked and unattractive and so he lashed out at me.\nsupporter:Realizing someone isn't the same you fell in love with seems valid. Fighting over a salad is definately not something most couples argue over.\nsupporter:He probably did feel attacked, but I am sure he noticed the continual fighting as well\nsupporter:It sounds like you did what was best for you. We all deserve to be happy, and it sounds like you really were not anymore.\nsupporter:Are you having any regrets on the breakup?\nseeker:I think I did the right thing, not just for me but for him. It isn't fair to keep dating someone just because being single is hard. \nI just still get weird lingering feelings wondering if he was right and maybe I am too much for a lot of people. I don't think he is right, and my friends disagree but it still hurts and I can still hear him tell me no one would ever love me.\nseeker:No, I don't think I have any regrets.\nsupporter:I think I have said the same thing in a breakup so I wouldn't take that personal.\nseeker:Yeah? I suppose people just say things when they are hurt.\nsupporter:People say things they dont mean, or just say mean things to hurt because they are hurting\nsupporter:lol exactly\nsupporter:I bet there is someone out there for you, you jut need to find someone whos ideas of the future line up with yours\nseeker:Thank you.

I wake up in the middle of the night and I am gasping for air, too.\nsupporter:Thanks for sharing that with me. I'm so sorry you've been feeling like that. Breakups are so hard and can cause so much grief.\nseeker:Yes, I feel like I will never meet anyone else and that I wasted so much time.\nsupporter:I know those feelings of sadness can feel like they will never end- I have felt that way too before.\nseeker:Do you feel like the best part of your life was over? That is how I feel now. Its seem like all of my plans for the future are over and ruined.\nsupporter:But they do pass eventually and become easier to manage- with time and care. Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?\nseeker:I have a best friend but she told me that she didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning so she is glad that we broke up. Well, that I got dumped.\nsupporter:It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?\nseeker:I have been wanting to buy a bike and start taking my dog out for little bike rides. I want to get one with a basket and have her sit in the front. I just hate being alone and I feel so sad about doing everything alone now.\nsupporter:That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love.\nseeker:I just bought my puppy and she is super comforting. I think that because she was a recuse dog I feel a greater attachment. It is kind of nice having her.\nsupporter:My dog has also helped me meet other people and make friends- sometimes I'll walk my dog with others or go on bike rides with friends. If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!\nseeker:I know about a local dog park and think I will visit it today. That is a really good idea. I don't need a bike for that.\nsupporter:I'm glad to hear that! I hope you have a great time there! Research has also shown that spending time outside everyday is really good for our mental health.\nseeker:You are giving me something to think about that isn't related to the break up. I feel like a weight is sort of lifting off of me. I think I needed to talk and get some of my feelings on the table today.\nsupporter:If you are still interested in getting a bike, I'd say go for it too! Biking is a great stress relief and form of exercise that often makes me feel better.\nsupporter:I am so glad to hear that and am so happy you are talking to me is making you feel better.\nseeker:Yes, I really want to get one but since I don't have a lot of money right now I will waitr on that and go to the dog park instead. I also heard about yoga iin the park.\nsupporter:Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive.\nseeker:I am feeling like life still goes on and things are going on all around me. I am going to start seeing whats out there and trying to join in a little bit more. My dog is opening a door for me and with your encouragement too.\nsupporter:I am very glad to hear that.

I get sick of having to say that of course I love her.\nsupporter:I can relate because I also have a close friend that seeks constant reaffirmations.\nsupporter:Have you spoken with her about this?\nseeker:I have.

I totally understand being stressed out by school. I am currently in a Ph.D. program and it can be overwhelming. Do you have any hobbies to help with your stress?\nseeker:I do like to read, but I haven't had enough time. I have been going on walks more frequently.\nsupporter:It sounds like you do a lot of activities that are solitary. Have you considered maybe partaking in a similar activity, like a book club, where there is more interaction with people?\nseeker:No, I did not consider that actually. I do enjoy my alone time since I am so busy and I have a toddler, but maybe doing something more sociable would be good.\nsupporter:Being busy, especially with having a small child can make you feel lonely, enhancing the stress you feel from school. Participating in social events geared toward your interest might be able to connect you to people with similar feelings!\nseeker:I think so too. I never thought of it like that.\nsupporter:I'm sure that you are trying your best to be both a good student and a great parent. It is understandable that you may not have considered those options.\nseeker:Yes I constantly think of my son and family, and I didn't think involving myself in sociable activities\n would be beneficial.\nseeker:I figured I really needed some alone time. I didn't realize I could be experiencing loneliness.\nsupporter:It is so admirable that you are acting so selfless.\nsupporter:Are you aware of any activities that you can participate in that can include your family? It could be the best of both worlds.\nseeker:Yes, we like to go swimming at the YMCA together.\nsupporter:That is great! Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress levels.\nsupporter:My sister-in-law really benefits from having her sons in sports. She is able to connect with the other team moms and considers them some of her best friends. Depending on your YMCA your son may be able to participate in some of their programs?\nseeker:Yes, and swimming is great exercise.\nseeker:And if we do that more we can spend more time together.\nseeker:I have been looking into putting him in soccer.\nseeker:He can start at 3 years old.\nsupporter:Soccer would be a perfect way for both you and your son to interact with other people of similar interests.\nseeker:I think so too. You gave me a lot to think about today that I didn't consider before.\nsupporter:I am glad to help, Hopefully, considering these options will not only reduce your stress from being busy with being a parent and with school, but it will also bring you closer to your child.\nseeker:Yes, and both of those are major goals of mine. But the stress sometimes feels inevitable.\nsupporter:Sometimes stress is inevitable. You just have to know how to channel it. Some use physical activity, others use journaling. These seem to be outlets you can consider?\nseeker:The physical activity for sure.\nseeker:I do so much writing with my Master's program. Sometimes I feel like my hand will fall off.\nsupporter:Physical activity seems to be the option you are most interested in.\nsupporter:Have you considered setting daily exercise goals?\nseeker:Yes, I am a pretty active and fit person.\nseeker:Yes, I do try to go to the gym 3 times per week at least.\nsupporter:Having goals for a given day can help motivate you to do the exercises and keep your head cleared from stress.\nseeker:I agree. I will definitely start to engage in more activities with peers and more swimming with my family.

He's great, but it's just not the same as having a friend to turn to.  I feel every time I reach out to the friends I do have they are too busy with their families to talk.\nsupporter:I feel a lot of people are in your situation especially with Covid going on.  Do you connect with friends on social media at all (like facebook)?\nseeker:Yea, I do comment on their social media and follow up with their lives there.  I do not actively post about my own life because we have been extremely cautious with covid as I am high risk, so we don't even go grocery shopping.  I think I am just feeling fatigued of being stuck inside, which makes me feel sad about everything else.\nsupporter:I can totally understand where you are coming from.  I think it is great that you are at least getting a little communication with facebook.  I am guessing you will be in line for a vaccination also in the up coming month which I think will help your mood as well.\nseeker:Yes, I am awaiting my turn for the vaccine and I am very much looking forward to getting it so I can get back to some normalcy.  I miss being able to go shopping or sitting in a coffee shop.  These activities helped me in the past, so I look forward to being able to get out and do them again.  I used to visit my friends too and we'd have lunch or coffee at their house, but obviously I haven't been able to do that lately.  I will be able to once I get the vaccine.\nsupporter:I was able to get my first dose of this vaccine this past Sunday.  I was very surprised how good I felt this week like a weight being lifted off my shoulders.  I work with high school kids so it was nice not thinking about covid all the time.  I not it might not help for you today but I think it will give you something to look forward as you move forward in the upcoming weeks.\nsupporter:*I know\nseeker:That's so exciting for you!  I am hoping I will be able to get mine in the coming weeks.  I've definitely been looking forward to getting it.  I decided a week ago that I would get a puppy as a companion.  So I am looking forward to that, but he will not be coming home until the beginning of May.  But you're right I need to look forward to the things that will bring me happiness even though it's hard right now.\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

I guess I can look into that. I am from Ohio. That's not bad advice.\nseeker:I am somewhat kicking myself for paying so much money on education that wasn't really worth that much. I guess there isn't much I can do about that, though\nsupporter:Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up.\nsupporter:Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you.\nsupporter:Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?\nseeker:I suppose there can be truth in that. I had a friend say that as well, that education is never a wasted effort. I agree sometimes. I should have thought about the program more before I went into it, but ah, oh well. Nothing I can do about it, now.\nseeker:No, it wouldn't be transferable.\nseeker:I have though about doing some grad school for something bio related. I don't know.\nseeker:I'm 30 now and getting burned out, to be honest\nseeker:Anyway, you've said a lot of nice and helpful things. I don't want to take too much time from you.

Any suggestions on how to have that conversation?\nsupporter:I can see that you worry about your boss seeing you as argumentative, but could you try it from the perspective of making your boss feel like he is in control?\nseeker:Making it his idea.

Just daily stresses such as disrupted life routines from the pandemic and growing anxiety as my city is facing the beginning of the second wave.\nsupporter:i surely understand you. this pandemic has been really stressful.\nseeker:yeah you bet\nseeker:for example, I only go out once or twice a week for my job, and once every two weeks for groceries. And that's it. But even then, when I have to be in close quarters with coworkers and even to go out for groceries, that scares me.\nsupporter:yeah, people are not social distancing enough.\nsupporter:but wearing a mask and then using sanitizer should at least give us a bit of a confidence\nseeker:like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks!\nseeker:it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city.\nsupporter:at least now i hope the city will put in more restrictions and mandate mask wearing.\nseeker:yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope.\nseeker:well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5.\nsupporter:have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something\nseeker:too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down \nselective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc.\nsupporter:hmm, that's a bummer.\nseeker:yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say\nsupporter:okay\nseeker:but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support.\nseeker:But thanks for that advice, it's a good idea\nsupporter:that's great. having a supportive friend/family is so much a blessing during this pandemic\nseeker:yes definitely, since I live alone and pretty much self isolated since March of this year.\nseeker:I have gotten used to it and more comfortable. Before I was more nervous, lonely, and claustrophobic. It is better now but my fear is coming back due to the rising cases.\nsupporter:yeah, i can understand.\nsupporter:do you have any hobbies or interests that you can work on to help you put your mind away for sometime?\nseeker:yeah thanks for listening. And this does impact my daily routines, from my workout patterns, sleep patterns, and diet.\nseeker:yeah somewhat\nseeker:but not productive energy. I tend to be lethargic, immobile at my computer for long times, surfing the net aimlessly when I should be studying, and just distracted.\nsupporter:there are a good number of online forums for most of the hobbies/interests.. that'll help you share your work and also get some additional ideas\nseeker:and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated.\nseeker:okay yeah good idea.\nseeker:I can look for more videos too on such resources\nseeker:like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project.\nsupporter:putting away my phone has helped me a lot. also, i have designed a daily routine to include more of the tasks that i like\nseeker:Just pretty much my studies with two online courses and not even reading anything outside of school. And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way.\nseeker:ok yeah great ideas\nsupporter:yeah, try to start learning a new musical instrument of your choice. maybe just 30-60 mins everyday.\nseeker:I have started to put away my phone\nseeker:as I realize that I use it a lot too\nsupporter:nice\nseeker:So I put it at the opposite end of my room for example\nseeker:started doing that lately and so the screen time has reduced somewhat\nseeker:so just trying to channel my productive energy into finishing school deadlines\nsupporter:social media and then this relentless flow of covid news/info is also stressful\nseeker:yeah for sure, especially following up news from around the world and in the states\nseeker:just stressful loads of news just catching up to daily events\nseeker:and as for daily schedule, yes I have kind of more control on that too as I try to write down what I should do now and set an alarm to start doing this at this time etc, especially in juggling my school work.\nseeker:but yeah your ideas are great and match my thinking exactly\nsupporter:yepp. i read a book - 'atomic habits'. and kind of designed a daily routine. this helping me a lot and reducing stress as well.\nseeker:I see. okay I will keep doing that.\nseeker:I will search that book too, interesting title\nsupporter:and also try and note down things that stress or upset you. and then over a period try to avoid those triggers.\nseeker:okay then. I am good to go on that note. Thanks for reaching out and listening. It's great that you understand and am providing great advice.\nseeker:ok\nseeker:kind of a reminder on what stresses me and to avoid that etc\nseeker:that's great\nseeker:like a debriefing\nseeker:you've given a lot of great suggestions actually. Thanks a lot for that\nsupporter:yepp. and if you try to remove or avoid those triggers, it will really help\nseeker:you've been quite helpful\nseeker:for sure. I believe that also\nseeker:avoiding stressors and cope\nsupporter:sure no problem. hope you get through this and also be able to successfully complete your school courses\nseeker:yeah I am okay.

Is there something bothering you that causes you to stay awake during the night?\nseeker:I can't think of anything particular,  but my mood has been low generally for the last wee while which I imagine is probably the cause. I'm so tired during the day but as soon as my head hits the pillow at night I'm wide awake.\nsupporter:Well it sounds like you’re tired enough for sleep, but you’re still wired and can’t get the sleep you need.\nseeker:That's exactly it. Do you have any advice on what I can do?\nsupporter:Are you getting any physical activity in during the day to make body more willing to cooperate?\nseeker:I'm working in a desk job so spend almost all day sitting down. That could be part of the problem.\nsupporter:I’ve found that physical activity helps me to get to sleep even when I’m troubled mentally.  Another option is to slow your brain down so that your mind is relaxed.  That is much harder for me though!\nseeker:That's a good idea. I could try go out for a walk either before or after work as a starting point and see if that makes a difference.\nsupporter:That sounds like a good plan!  It also helps to make sure that it’s dark and very quiet.  Surprisingly enough, when they did research on sleep disorders they found that a lot of people just needed quiet and darkness.\nseeker:Have you tried lavender? I have heard pillow or room sprays can be good for sleep.\nsupporter:Yep, I’ve tried a LOT of things.  I’m currently struggling with this myself.  I’m even trying out melatonin, tryptophan, and even CBD (not stoney weed oil)!  So far no success, but I’m still trying!\nseeker:I've heard people mention melatonin - I might use that later if other methods dont work. It's good to know other people are in the same boat.\nsupporter:It’s one of the reasons that it’s good to get outside.  Your body makes melatonin from sunshine, so going for a walk outside helps in 2 ways!\nseeker:If we had a little more sunshine where I live that would be fantastic!\nBased on the conversation above, please follow the instructions below:\n[Instruction]\n1. **Analyze the seeker's emotional state**:  \nBased on the seeker's latrain message and conversation history, choose the most appropriate emotion from this list:  \n[Neutral, Positive, Anxiety, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Shame]\n2. **Summarize only relevant seeker information**:  \nIdentify the seeker information from the conversation history that is relevant for crafting your response.

That could be part of the problem.\nsupporter:I’ve found that physical activity helps me to get to sleep even when I’m troubled mentally.  Another option is to slow your brain down so that your mind is relaxed.  That is much harder for me though!\nseeker:That's a good idea. I could try go out for a walk either before or after work as a starting point and see if that makes a difference.\nsupporter:That sounds like a good plan!  It also helps to make sure that it’s dark and very quiet.  Surprisingly enough, when they did research on sleep disorders they found that a lot of people just needed quiet and darkness.\nseeker:Have you tried lavender? I have heard pillow or room sprays can be good for sleep.\nsupporter:Yep, I’ve tried a LOT of things.  I’m currently struggling with this myself.  I’m even trying out melatonin, tryptophan, and even CBD (not stoney weed oil)!  So far no success, but I’m still trying!\nseeker:I've heard people mention melatonin - I might use that later if other methods dont work. It's good to know other people are in the same boat.\nsupporter:It’s one of the reasons that it’s good to get outside.  Your body makes melatonin from sunshine, so going for a walk outside helps in 2 ways!\nseeker:If we had a little more sunshine where I live that would be fantastic!\nsupporter:Getting good sleep is critical.  Supplementing with melatonin might help compensate for your lack of sunshine!\nseeker:I'll look into it for sure.

I have a final coming up after next week.\nsupporter:School can be very demanding. What has you stressed?\nseeker:yeah just trying to speed through the readings as I still have more than a few units to read through\nsupporter:All nighters can be rough. Do you have snacks and caffeine?\nseeker:and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, \nand another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month.\nseeker:yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee.\nseeker:I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc.\nseeker:it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess\nsupporter:You can master it within in a month, you are already getting a head start\nseeker:yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind.\nseeker:just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings\nsupporter:Yes the pandemic has created a lot of challenges for routines and schedules\nseeker:plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course.\nseeker:yeah it sure has.\nseeker:I can go on and on about that too\nsupporter:I am confident you can succeed, it sounds like you have a plan and dedication\nseeker:And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately.\nseeker:thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic.\nsupporter:That is a tough cycle to break.\nseeker:yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started.\nsupporter:I think you're saying you will have go put your nose to the grind\nseeker:so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses.\nseeker:and get back to some normalcy in my life routines.\nseeker:it will literally be a fresh start, next january\nsupporter:Yes, definitely allow yourself time to breathe\nseeker:yeah exactly, nose to the grind\nseeker:yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc.\nsupporter:I think you sound very capable, despite the amount of stress you're under\nseeker:its all linked and most of it is due to the pandemic and the studies is just a reinforcement of this loop, fuels it actually.\nsupporter:You can get back on track with those healthy behaviors\nseeker:Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again.\nseeker:Thank you for your advice\nseeker:I hope I can break my bad cycles like I said.\nsupporter:You are welcome. I definitely relate to how you feel\nseeker:Thanks. Yeah I can see that you understand. That's good\nsupporter:I believe in you!\nseeker:thank you very much! I will continue to study after we chat.
