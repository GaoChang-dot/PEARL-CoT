I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms). [SEP] That is a position right there in the line of fire. [SEP] Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background. [SEP] I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but  [SEP]  their values are not walked out [SEP] I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval.

I used to see a therapist. It was very difficult for me to do in the beginning, but once I got to know them, they provided me with coping strategies that otherwise, I never would have thought of.

This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class. [SEP] Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense? [SEP] Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things. [SEP] Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience [SEP] Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference. [SEP] Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it [SEP] Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.",

But I swear, every single one of my teachers just seems so imcompetent at times.

Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there [SEP] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep. [SEP] Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you. [SEP] I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that. [SEP] I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming. [SEP] I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that. [SEP] I always lose sight of how to make things better. It really helps to talk sometimes so someone can help me put things into perspective. I'll look into Frank Hammond! I am actually religious and would love to look into that. [SEP] I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who \"get\" you is SO vital to our lives.

I just feel like avoiding it, but I do not know if anyone else would do the same. What would you do? [SEP] I would apologize for my behavior to the manager if it was me. Just to seem professional and get in my bosses good grace.",

[SEP] Im sorry to hear that :( [SEP] yeah the virus has been putting a huge damper on everyone's mood [SEP] I just miss seeing my friends [SEP] All of us are in this together and if you tolerate short term inconveniences (lockdown, masking up, social distancing), long term benefits are multi fold.

I'm finishing up my master's in HY and really just don't want to do more school.

I see there is some dependency between her and her kids yes. This is a serious problem and now I am concerned about you. [SEP] It is hard to change people, and the situation might not change quickly.
