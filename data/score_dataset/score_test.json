[SEP] it happened about a week ago..my boyfriend is being very possessive about everything I do [SEP] I find it not convincing and broke up with him [SEP] I see. Were you living with your boyfriend? How was your life post breakup? [SEP] ye since an year..Iam feeling an emptyness in my life [SEP] Do you suggest anything to come out of this [SEP] I am sorry to hear that. It must be difficult. I have gone through a lot of breakups in my life too, and I  know what you are going through.",

Now they will not stop contacting my friends and family and posting about me on social media [SEP] That sounds difficult and stressful. What do you do when you see it happening? [SEP] I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore [SEP] It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you? [SEP] I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point [SEP] That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop? [SEP] I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me [SEP] You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?",

[SEP] It might help them a lot to have someone stable in their life though? [SEP] they have fathers. I am not involved like that. we had a short relationship and I am sure her girls will be bitter with me even tho i did the correct thing by turning her in. [SEP] but the guilt from turning her in is terrible. [SEP] You did the right thing. Would you have wanted the girls to end up as addicts, dead or in prison? [SEP] She was not a good person. So it makes it easy to not regret it. but i still feel guilty. guilt caused issues last month when this all started and came to a head. it was a mess. I was a mess. things happened. [SEP] Do you think that perhaps the guilt is not entirely related to your circumstances currently?",

Now what should I do about them as other friends in our peer group are also concerned? [SEP] Ok, I understand. Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment? [SEP] I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm  [SEP] not quite sure how to do that? [SEP] You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch. [SEP] I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion. [SEP] I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.",
