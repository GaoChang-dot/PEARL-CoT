Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far [SEP] Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights [SEP] I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? [SEP] Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure. [SEP] I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class [SEP] I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)",

[SEP] do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better? [SEP] Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. [SEP] remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else. [SEP] I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. [SEP] have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.",

[SEP] yes I works in a broad wide company. So I will manage [SEP] If I may offer a suggestion. Have you thought of contacting a debt relief program? In some cases they can substantially reduce debt to something much more manageable.",

I have had problems and sometime negative interactions about Covid with some friends too.

It's also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge, which you still need even if you aren't currently employed.  Times are still very stressful and uncertain, and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are. [SEP] That's true. Very good points. It's hard to find a purpose right now because I'm unable to find work. When I started going to school I certainly wasn't expecting any of this to be happening (obviously). I waited until my 30s to go to college so I feel angry that all of this is happening. [SEP] I understand being angry about that.  Going to school supposedly is/was a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was. [SEP] I sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes.  I am also in my thirties. [SEP] But I personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if I never finished my degree.  We all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously.

Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them. [SEP] It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain. [SEP] I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this. [SEP] Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. [SEP] Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat? [SEP] I talked about it with one friend. He felt bad but what I couldn't understand why he was secretive about the chat too. If he thought we were close why hide stuff?

I have a few friends that no matter how long you discuss, they won't let the conversation end unless \"they are right.\" It seems like your friend doesn't like it when he is wrong?

[SEP] Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too? [SEP] That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years. [SEP] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person.

[SEP] Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately. [SEP] Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone.

He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years. [SEP] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost \"hiding\" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person. [SEP] Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting. I think this needs to stop. [SEP] A suggestion I would make would be to hangout with him in person, and bring up the issues that you and your friends have been seeing. But it's important to not make him feel overwhelmed. Almost like he is being \"ganged up on.\" [SEP] Yes that's good advice, I think we need to be tactful and raise it in the right way. Have you ever experienced something like this with a friend yourself? [SEP] I can tell that you care about this person as a friend, but you are worried that the way he thinks and talks may ruin that in a way. Make sure to let him know these concerns!

If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress.

You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly. [SEP] He knows I am miserable.

I have experienced that at times as well, and found it quite frustrating! [SEP] How much sleep are you getting now?   Do you keep irregular sleep hours, e.g. the time you go to bed and get up? [SEP] Yes, I had a bad sleeping schedule, when I would go to sleep around 2-3am. I now get around 8 hours of sleep but I feel like it isn't enough still. [SEP] Would this relate to a health problem of not being active or maybe stress? [SEP] I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning.  I reset my schedule very gradually.  I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later.  I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes.

[SEP] you are correct but the crisis is getting normal day by day ,after set to normal there ll be a great demand for growth of economy since it was not too good because of pandemic. the demand for workers too increase surely you ll have a chance to cope up don't fed up dude [SEP] Unfortunately as an athiest, I don't have the same beliefs. Just so long as my family have food on the table and a roof over their heads then I'm content with my life.

[SEP] that's good! prayer is the ultimate weapon we have and the god ll never let us suffer in such a way [SEP] Are you working from home since pandemic?",

[SEP] Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds? [SEP] Each stenographer has their own \"Personal Dictionary\" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno.  This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently. [SEP] OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol [SEP] Is this your first holiday alone? [SEP] Yes, exactly!  And it's very important to back up your personal dictionary to the cloud or a seperate drive so that you don't lose it in a hard-drive crash.  A lot of work goes into creating that dictionary!  No, it's happened before, being along for the holidays; but you've helped to cheer me up, so thanks! [SEP] No problem, I hope I have made your day a little better!",

[SEP] One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well. [SEP] I am really afraid here I don't know what to do [SEP] As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals. [SEP] It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong. [SEP] I don't like the noise of ambulance at all any time I see one I don't feel happy [SEP] I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you. [SEP] One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt.

[SEP] Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship.

As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint? [SEP] Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. [SEP] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress. [SEP] Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. [SEP] I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. [SEP] Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.",

Sometimes you just have to take a step back and have a conversation with someone not in the thick of it. [SEP] Absolutely, I have no emotional stake in this. The two of you do and that can cloud things sometimes. [SEP] I think people get territorial when they have worked somewhere and a new person comes in. I see that now.

[SEP] If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I  do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom. [SEP] I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before God one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you CAN be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :D [SEP] I suggest a book called \"Bounderies\" one of the authors is Townsend -- great book. [SEP] I think I just need to learn a new approach to how I handle my dealings with other people. [SEP] Might be on youtube too. Good stuff on how to say no and set boundaries! :D",

Especially someone who is not at your company. Do you know anyone, even a friend of a friend, who could maybe be a sounding board for your career? [SEP] Haha you're a good rando.

I'm honestly the snowflake in the family. [SEP] Oh say no more! I totally get that just based on my own background as well.

        "input": "I do know people who have gone through the exact same thing in the past. When another animal attacks one of your fur-babies, it's absolutely terrible. However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong. [SEP] If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked? [SEP] I totally agree with you!  The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her.  I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s).  I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it.  I think everyone feels sorry for her. [SEP] That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs. [SEP] I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted.  The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying.  My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore.  I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured.  I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean! [SEP] I guess I could try talking to them again.  Maybe they've cooled off some. [SEP] That is absolutely terrible. In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby. Had you not done anything, this could have happened again, and the outcome may have been much worse. At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated. I always try to keep things calm and quiet, but I refuse to be taken advantage of or treated poorly. [SEP] Personally, as I stated previously, I wholeheartedly believe that you did the right thing. If they're unable to see that, I'd try to just avoid contact with them unless it's necessary. I know it stinks and I'd be sad too, but unfortunately, some people just don't know how to let things go and seem to find joy in making other people upset.

Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time. [SEP] I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands! [SEP] You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time. [SEP] Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful. [SEP] It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run. You can do this!",

I can see from his part he feels upset and frustrated because he may feel useless at the moment. But that's not an excuse to neglect responsibilities.

Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)? [SEP] I love walking outside.  We had a 60 degree day not too long ago and I went outside immediately to walk.  My mood was better that day than it has been in months.  I am definitely looking forward to spring, which is quickly approaching now!  I have to say, I appreciate you pushing me in the direction of thinking positively and looking forward to the future, it's something I definitely lost my grasp on for a little while.

Getting a puppy       In the mean time,  I think it helps to try to keep busy.   Is there goals you can set for yourself each day?  Like maybe working on a room for a puppy, to take a walk outside each day, an area of the house that should get cleaned, or start a new hobby (like finding a book you have been meaning to read) [SEP] You're definitely right I have a lot to be excited about.  I like the idea of setting goals each day.  Now that the weather is slightly nicer I think going for a daily walk is a good idea.  Also, definitely preparing for puppy and getting an area set up and arranged for him is a great idea.  I find myself mindlessly scrolling the internet many days so reading a book is also a great idea. [SEP] Maybe even with each day that you make a point to contact a friend each day either by phone call, email, or facebook?  Just say Hi - how are you doing? - look forward to meeting up at some point for coffee.   This might get an engaging conversation going with some of your friends. [SEP] That's a good point, maybe an e-mail as that is something they may check when they have some down time, where as when I text I feel a lot of times they look at it and are busy and then forget to respond.  But if they sit down and are checking their emails maybe they will have time for a quick response. [SEP] Yes that is good low-key way of connecting.  Rather than a call or text message.

Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? [SEP] That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying. [SEP] Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. [SEP] What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time [SEP] I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. [SEP] That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that. [SEP] Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot [SEP] I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days.

I fell out of love with him slowly and grew more annoyed by a lot of his behaviors. [SEP] To me we were fighting a lot, and about dumb stuff like whether or not a salad is a meal.

[SEP] I see and this makes you uncomfortable because if you say no they will think you are not a caring person.
